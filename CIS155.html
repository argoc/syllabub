&#x2605; Computer Expectations:
</h3><p>
It is expected that the student will have <b>a basic knowledge of the use of a microcomputer and keyboard at 20wpm with precision</b>. 
This is *NOT* an introduction to basic computer literacy. A basic understanding of and manipulation of the windows interface is expected. 
In particular, students should know how to use Windows Explorer (or similar) to manipulate (save, copy, delete, move, etc.) files, have access to the Internet, know how to use your browser, fill out Web forms, use email (including attachments), and similar basic Web skills. 
If you do not feel comfortable with these basic skills, it is recommended that you consider taking CIS 150 Survey of Computing prior to taking this class to build computer literacy and BSTEC 110 for keyboarding.
</p><p><b class="t911">
Please develop a plan "B" in case you have issues with your normal Internet access and related software that might affect your ability to participate in this class.

<h4 id="help">&#x2714; Ask for help! (It is really OK)</h4>
<p>
If you need assistance or are having problems in this class, please visit with me during my office hours in person, by phone, or online (via Skype) so we can discuss your options. If those times don't work for you, send a Canvas message to make an appointment with me.
I know being a student, especially a new student, can be challenging, confusing, and frustrating at times. The good news is, you can do it! Don't be afraid to ask me, other students, or any OC staff member for help. Seek out other students to create a learning community where you can mutually support each other. We all have our experiences that might help you and each other. Don't be afraid to ask!
<span class="t911">The BEST WAY WAY TO CONTACT ME is to use the Canvas Inbox from the class Web site.</span> The Canvas Inbox is where I expect to locate student questions and comments. All other methods will take longer as well as not keep a centralized location for all our correspondence for to assist with documentation. I monitor Canvas throughout the day during the quarter and less on weekends and holidays.
<br/>
<br/>

<b>If we need to use email, I will use your Olympic College student email account.</b>
<br/> 
"The President's Council has made the decision that all email messages between students and faculty relating to classroom and/or college issues must use their Olympic College email accounts.  To that end, all OC students are required to use their OC email account." More information on OC email student accounts can be found at: 
<a href="http://www.olympic.edu/services/computer-labs/accounts">http://www.olympic.edu/services/computer-labs/accounts</a>"

<br/>
<br/>
<b>Olympic College Tutorial Services</b> provides help to students who need assistance beyond the classroom. A consortium of faculty and staff coordinates the program. Tutoring is provided in a variety of settings for most disciplines of study and takes place in lab/study centers, small groups and occasionally one-on-one.

<h4 id="Netiquette">&#x2714; Netiquette (How to act online)</h4>
<p>
Taken from the <a href="http://jolt.merlot.org/vol6no1/mintu-wimsatt_0310.htm">MERLOT Journal of Online Learning and Teaching</a> (under a Creative Commons Attribution-Non-Commercial-Share-Alike License).
This class will be based on the following interpretation of netiquette.
<br/>
<br/>
Since discussions are instrumental to the success of distance education (Al-Shalchi 2009), it is important that healthy and productive interactive environments are maintained. Otherwise, the repercussions may lead to the general "failure" of the discussion component of the entire course and/or for the remainder of the course. Herein lies the importance of having an established classroom etiquette and/or protocol as well as clearly defined consequences.
<br/>
<br/>
Netiquette, or Internet etiquette, is a way of defining professionalism through network communication.  Its derivation is based on the merging of the words "network" as well as "etiquette;" and, the concept is closely related to ethics (Scheuermann &amp; Taylor 1997). Netiquette refers to a set of core rules that delineates what should and should not be done with regards to online communication in order to maintain common courtesy (Shea 1994). In other words, in a classroom setting, netiquette deals with the proper decorum in online learning and CMD. For virtual classroom purposes, netiquette deals with the notions of respect, harmony and tolerance often manifested in the tone or function of the interactions (Conrad 2002; Curtis and Lawson 2001; Brown 2001).

Netiquette is a way of defining professionalism through network communication. 
<b style="color: #cc0000">"The college may impose disciplinary sanctions against a student who commits, or aids, abets, incites, encourages or assists another person to commit, an act(s) of misconduct."
</b>
Please see 
<a href="http://app.leg.wa.gov/WAC/default.aspx?cite=132C-120-065">WAC 132C-120-065(5)</a>
concerning cyber misconduct.
<br/>
<br/>
Here are some Student Guidelines for the class:
<ul>
<li>Do not dominate any discussion.</li>
<li>Do not use offensive language.</li>
<li>Never make fun of someone's ability to read or write.</li>
<li>Use simple English.</li>
<li>Use correct spelling and grammar.</li>
<li>Share tips with other students.</li>
<li>Keep an "open-mind" and be willing to express even your minority opinion.</li>
<li>Be aware of the OC's Academic Honesty Policy. 
(See <a href="http://app.leg.wa.gov/WAC/default.aspx?cite=132C-120-065">WAC 132C-120-065(1)</a>)
</li>
<li>Think before you push the "Send" button.</li>
<li>Do not hesitate to ask for feedback.</li>
<li>When in doubt, always check with your instructor for clarification.</li>
</ul>


<h4 id="WAC">&#x2714; WAC / Washington Administrative Code for Olympic College</h4>
<p>
Please review Olympic College's 
<a href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/wac/default.aspx?cite=132c">Title 132C WAC</a>
policies. The various WACs have been passed by the state of Washington and are Washington State law that govern the behavior of the administration, faculty, and students.
</p>

<h4 id="CID">&#x2714; Identification </h4>
<p>
All assignments must have a student name and assignment name clearly labeled. Please see the Web site for the name of the assignment. This is important for this course in particular, as not all of your work is uploaded to Canvas. Failure to follow these policies may result in the deduction of points.
</p>

<h4 id="asgn">&#x2714; Assignments (What you need to do to get a good grade)</h4>
<p>
By taking this class, you are stating that you will be making appropriate time in your schedule to ensure success and have access to the resources required for this class. <b>Expect to spend 1-2 hours outside of class/recordings per unit for every class credit to ensure success.</b> Example: 5 credit class = 9 hours outside of class/recordings per unit to allow time for your success. Thus, being a full-time student is a full-time job, around 40+ hours per week for class and study time. I understand that for many community college students, attending college is a part of a very busy life. I know many of you work and have families. When I was a graduate student, I worked full-time. As an undergraduate, I worked 20+ hours a week. I also have a family with two teens involved with activities and all the other stuff. I know things can get busy. Remember: You are responsible for your learning. 
You may be administratively withdrawn from class if you do not demonstrate participation for more than two consecutive units. 
You are the one who needs to invest the time. 
<b>Time management is your friend or your foe! Waiting until the evening of the due date to ask a question of an assignment may not be your best approach for success for this class. Start assignments early and be proactive.</b>
<b class="t911"> No assignment will be accepted for grading after the last due date.</b>
</p>


<h4 id="Due-dates">&#x2714; Due dates (When is my stuff due?)</h4>
<p>
Assignments are due on time / date given at the Web site. Online postings are due by midnight of the due date or they will be late. You can post assignments any time during the current unit. Note, the upload must complete prior to the due date/time. Start early! Please do not wait until the last minute to post due to normal connectivity issues associated with the Internet. 
<span class="t911">
All assignments MUST be posted before 11:59pm of the due date listed for a given unit using the appropriate posting for a given assignment. Assignments not posted in the appropriate form for a given unit will not be graded.
Any assignment not available at that time will be considered late and WILL NOT BE GRADED.
</span> 
Do not wait until the last minute to complete your assignments and make that your excuse. NOTE: Emailed assignments will not be accepted for grading unless specified as part of an assignment or previously approved.
</p>


<h4 id="Form-Confirmations">&#x2714; Submission Confirmations (It is for your protection!)</h4>
<p>
When assignments are posted at the Web site, verify that it was submitted. Go to the Grades tab and see if your work was registered there. This serves several purposes. It shows that your posting was accepted by the system and gives you an opportunity to verify the transaction. Since little or no paper is used in the class, your only documentation that you posted an assignment *is* the electronic gradebook. Please make a copy of your successful submission, either an electronic copy or printed a copy. Keep them safe in the event of a system failure and/or loss of postings at the class Web site. To date, loss of data is extremely rare but can happen since we are using the Internet for transmitting data. It is strongly recommend that you print out all your submission confirmations and place them into a confirmation notebook as your backup. Copies of your confirmations, except exams, can be found in the Grades section. If issues do arise, one of the first things I may ask to see is your submission confirmation. <b class="t911">Without a submission confirmation for an assignment, you may receive 0 points for an assignment.</b>
</p>

<h4 id="my-points">&#x2714; Monitor Your Progress (Don't let grades surprise you!)</h4>
<p>
You can monitor your unit progress by clicking on <b>Grades</b> on the site index as well as view what assignments you have posted to the class Web site. 
We post grades ASAP, usually within 7 days. 
A bit more during exams or if my schedule gets impacted. 
My goal is to give reasonable feedback to as many students as possible in the shortest time possible. 
If you have any questions, comments, concerns about an assignment, or would like detailed feedback, please feel free to use the Canvas Inbox on the left of most pages. 
</p>


<h4 id="late-work">&#x2714; Late work (It happens...)</h4>
<p>
You will be given a number of "Late Tickets" for you late work. These can be used on individual assignments only, not on any group work.
Late Tickets extend the availability of an assignment by 5 days.
For example, if you wish to use a Late Ticket for an assignment in unit 04, 
it MUST be submitted within 5 days of the original due date for consideration.
When you have run out of tickets, no more late work will be accepted. 
<b class="t911">Late Tickets can not be used for group work since they are impacting the rest of the group.</b> 
My goal is to be fair to all students and not suggest bias based on pre-existing situations. I would suggest you hold on to your Late Tickets as long as possible for real emergencies and not poor time management. 
The last day to post late work is the last due date of regular class assignments.
For Winter 2017, that is March 13.
Please see Late assignments as a courtesy and not as a right.
Late work will be graded at the discretion of the instructor both for points as well as to when the assignment will be graded.
The number of "Late Tickets" are listed in the Course Schedule section of the syllabus.
Late work maybe extended without a late ticket under very special circumstances in accordance with OC policies, like accessibility needs, with appropriate documentation. 
Use them wisely!
</p>

<h4 id="redo">&#x2714; Redo work (It is that important!)</h4>
<p>Occasionally I will suggest that an assignment be redone because it appears that the learning outcomes may not have been met regarding that assignment. <b class="t911">If a redo is suggested, a notice will posted in the Grades section in the comments area of your submission.</b> 
You need to resend the requested redo assignment in the requested timeframe (typically 3 days, though it may differ for time-critical activities) after points are posted for that assignment or the redo will *not* be graded and the grade given will stand. Please contact us via the Canvas Inbox for instructions and support.
Please see Redo assignments as a courtesy and not as a right.
Redo work will be graded at the discretion of the instructor both for points as well as to when the assignment will be graded.
</p>

<h4 id="withdrawing">&#x2714; Withdrawing (What to do if you need to leave the class)</h4>
<p>
If you wish to withdraw from this course, please file the appropriate paperwork with the Office of Registration and Records and then inform me of your decision. 
It is your responsibility to contact Registration and Records, otherwise you remain enrolled in the course.

<h4 id="expectations">&#x2714; Student expectations (Basic academic values)</h4>
<p>
This class is considered to be a college level class. 
It is expected that students will be tolerant of others views, be respectful in dealing with others, and use standard English in their communications, both written and verbal. 
Every employee at Olympic College, me included, take your education very seriously. We see education as a gateway to a better life. 
We hope you take the same view of your education and the opportunities OC can provide. 
At the end of the day, you need to make the choices to maximize your learning.
</p>

<h4 id="behavior">&#x2714; Classroom conduct (How to behave yourself in class)</h4>
<p>Disruptive behavior will not be tolerated, see 
<a href="http://app.leg.wa.gov/WAC/default.aspx?cite=132C-120-065">WAC 132C-120-065(3)</a>. 
For online class or online components, please see the Netiquette policies above.
For ground classes, please refrain from the following during lecture: talking, inappropriate language, using the computer (mouse or keyboard or printer), cell phones/pagers, guest (including children/OCP 200-06, it's the law), eating, sleeping, or other similar disturbance to the class unless a class code of conduct is in effect.
"The college may impose disciplinary sanctions against a student who commits, or aids, abets, incites, encourages or assists another person to commit, an act(s) of misconduct."
 Your cooperation is appreciated.
</p>

<h4 id="honesty">&#x2714; Academic honesty (It is a BIG deal in academics!)</h4>
<p>
No academic dishonesty will be tolerated, see 
<a href="http://app.leg.wa.gov/WAC/default.aspx?cite=132C-120-065">WAC 132C-120-065(1)</a>. 
"Any act of academic dishonesty including, but not limited to, cheating, plagiarism, and fabrication."
Evidence of academic dishonesty will result in a forfeiture of points for an assignment and may result in further administrative action.
"The college may impose disciplinary sanctions against a student who commits, or aids, abets, incites, encourages or assists another person to commit, an act(s) of misconduct."
</p>

<h4 id="military">&#x2714; Service members (I know you may have special situations)</h4>
<p>
I will try to work with service members (military, police, fire, and others in on-call emergency positions) as best possible to complete this class. 
You must notify me through Canvas before any special accommodations will be made that explains your special situation that may *temporarily* impact your ability to participate in this class. 
Please note that all assignments are open from the start of the quarter. 
If you know of an upcoming situation, please take advantage of this opportunity before requesting accommodations.
</p>

<h4 id="special">&#x2714; Special requests (Please document with a Canvas Inbox message!)</h4>
<p>
All special accommodations MUST be requested through the Canvas Inbox or OC email to develop a paper trail even if we have a face-to-face conversation. 
After a conversation, please send me a Canvas message or OC email ASAP so I'll have a reminder of what was discussed. 
<b class="t911">Without follow up documentation via the Canvas Inbox or OC email, please do not hold me accountable for any special requests.</b>
</p>

<h4 id="fair-use">&#x2714; Digital media and Fair Use (It is Federal Law!)</h4>
<p>
At the end of the quarter, please delete all media (videos, images, documents (like PowerPoints), or other media) used in the class for instructional purposes to be in compliance with 
<a href="http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#110">Title 17 of the United States Code &#xA7; 110(2)</a>
governing the use of "fair use" of copyrighted materials outside of a classroom setting.
Assume all material is copyrighted unless otherwise noted.
</p>

<h4 id="non-Discrimination">&#x2714; Non-Discrimination Statement (We take this seriously at OC)</h4>
<p>
Olympic College seeks to maintain a learning and working environment that is safe, welcoming, and respectful of the dignity of all members of the campus community.  
Accordingly, the College prohibits discrimination on the bases of race, color, religion, national origin, age, disability, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, pregnancy, veteran status and all other protected classifications.

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posttraumatic_stress_disorder">PTSD</a>
or 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asperger_syndrome">asperger syndrome</a>). 
Most disabilities at OC are invisible.
As an instructor, I can not disclose a student's disability. 
The decision to share with others is a choice of the student.

Many things can impact your ability to be successful in a college class that has lots of dependance on computing and access to the Internet.
By starting early, you give yourself an extra buffer when things get a bit bumpy on the Information Highway like Websites bing down for a few hours for things like maintenance or technical issues or local issues like running out of paper or system updates. 
These things happen as well as your education add additional demands and expectations to your probably already complex life.

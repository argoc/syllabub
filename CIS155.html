<p>MindTap is an online subscription that we will use throughout the course. It is the main material needed to do this course. It comes bundled with the textbook in an eBook version. That means the entire textbook is included and can be read online via MindTap. This is all that is required; however, some other options exist and may be better suited in some circumstances. Here are some alternative options that may work better:

<p>The textbook we will use for this course is titled New Perspectives on HTML5 and CSS3, 7th Edition, Comprehensive, by Patrick Carey. It can be purchased separately if desired. Here the ISBNs for separate purchases:
<ul>
<li>Bound texbook alone: ISBN-10: 1305503937; ISBN-13: 9781305503939</li>
<li>Loose leaf textbook alone: ISBN-10: 1337707805; ISBN-13: 9781337707800</li>
<li>eBook/Rental: ISBN-10: 1337668095; ISBN-13: 9781337668095</li>
</ul>
<p>All course materials are available at the College Bookstore (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.. They can also be purchased directly from the publisher. For MindTap without the textbook bundled, visit <a href="https://www.cengagebrain.com/shop">https://www.cengagebrain.com/shop</a>.</p>

<p>Students may find some cost savings by shopping around. Whichever way you make your purchase, please be sure you have at least MindTap bundled with the e-textbook, and be sure you are using the 7th edition!</p>

<p>We begin with an introductory discussion and some setup exercises in Module 0. After that, for each module you will be completing a quiz and Case Problem 1 from the corresponding chapter in the book; and throughout the class you will be working on a 4-part project that builds on concepts (the BoC) used in the class, developing a static website. The BoC projects will be shared with your peers; you will be reviewing two peers' BoC projects at three points in the quarter. In our final module, we will look at GitHub Pages, an alternative website publishing, and do a final revision of your site.</p>
<p>If you are in the late-start section,, assignments are due <strong>every five days</strong>. You will need to refer to Canvas for your due dates. This means each module's assignment is due two days of the week earlier than the previous module's. It is important to stay on top of the due dates and get your work in on time. Late work is generally not accepted.</p>

<article id="Expectations"><h3>
&#x2605; Computer Expectations:
</h3><p>
It is expected that the student will have <b>a basic knowledge of the use of a personal computer and keyboard at 20wpm with precision</b>.
This is *NOT* an introduction to basic computer literacy. A basic understanding of and manipulation of the windows interface is expected.
In particular, students should know how to use Windows Explorer (or similar) to manipulate (save, copy, delete, move, etc.) files, have access to the Internet, know how to use your browser, fill out Web forms, use email (including attachments), and similar basic Web skills.
If you do not feel comfortable with these basic skills, it is recommended that you consider taking CIS 150 Survey of Computing prior to taking this class to build computer literacy and BSTEC 110 for keyboarding.
</p><p><b class="t911">
Please develop a plan "B" in case you have issues with your normal Internet access and related software that might affect your ability to participate in this class.

<h4 id="Netiquette">&#x2714; Netiquette (How to act online)</h4>
<p>
Taken from the <a href="http://jolt.merlot.org/vol6no1/mintu-wimsatt_0310.htm">MERLOT Journal of Online Learning and Teaching</a> (under a Creative Commons Attribution-Non-Commercial-Share-Alike License).
This class will be based on the following interpretation of netiquette.
<br/>
<br/>
Since discussions are instrumental to the success of distance education (Al-Shalchi 2009), it is important that healthy and productive interactive environments are maintained. Otherwise, the repercussions may lead to the general "failure" of the discussion component of the entire course and/or for the remainder of the course. Herein lies the importance of having an established classroom etiquette and/or protocol as well as clearly defined consequences.
<br/>
<br/>
Netiquette, or Internet etiquette, is a way of defining professionalism through network communication.  Its derivation is based on the merging of the words "network" as well as "etiquette;" and, the concept is closely related to ethics (Scheuermann &amp; Taylor 1997). Netiquette refers to a set of core rules that delineates what should and should not be done with regards to online communication in order to maintain common courtesy (Shea 1994). In other words, in a classroom setting, netiquette deals with the proper decorum in online learning and CMD. For virtual classroom purposes, netiquette deals with the notions of respect, harmony and tolerance often manifested in the tone or function of the interactions (Conrad 2002; Curtis and Lawson 2001; Brown 2001).
<br/>
<br/>
Netiquette is a way of defining professionalism through network communication.
<b style="color: #cc0000">"The college may impose disciplinary sanctions against a student who commits, or aids, abets, incites, encourages or assists another person to commit, an act(s) of misconduct."

concerning cyber misconduct.
<br/>
<br/>
Here are some Student Guidelines for the class:
<ul>
<li>Do not dominate any discussion.</li>
<li>Do not use offensive language.</li>
<li>Never make fun of someone's ability to read or write.</li>
<li>Use simple English.</li>
<li>Use correct spelling and grammar.</li>
<li>Share tips with other students.</li>
<li>Keep an "open-mind" and be willing to express even your minority opinion.</li>
<li>Be aware of the OC's Academic Honesty Policy.
(See <a href="http://app.leg.wa.gov/WAC/default.aspx?cite=132C-120-065">WAC 132C-120-065(1)</a>)
</li>
<li>Think before you push the "Send" button.</li>
<li>Do not hesitate to ask for feedback.</li>
<li>When in doubt, always check with your instructor for clarification.</li>
</ul>


<h4 id="WAC">&#x2714; WAC / Washington Administrative Code for Olympic College</h4>
<p>
Please review Olympic College's
<a href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/wac/default.aspx?cite=132c">Title 132C WAC</a>
policies. The various WACs have been passed by the state of Washington and are Washington State law that govern the behavior of the administration, faculty, and students.
</p>

<h4 id="CID">&#x2714; Identification (Say who/what/when)</h4>
<p>
All assignments must have a student name, class, assignment, and date clearly labeled. For code files, this information must be present in comments within the file. Please see Canvas for the name of the assignment. This is important for this course in particular, as not all of your work is uploaded to Canvas. Failure to follow these policies may result in the deduction of points.
</p>

<h4 id="asgn">&#x2714; Assignments (What you need to do to get a good grade)</h4>
<p>
By taking this class, you are stating that you will be making appropriate time in your schedule to ensure success and have access to the resources required for this class. <b>Expect to spend 2-3 hours per module for each class credit to ensure success.</b> So for this 5 credit class, you might spend 10-15 hours per module to allow time for your success.
<p>In late start sections, modules are compressed since we have 8 weeks to fit into but must still have the standard work of a 10 week course; that means each week will typically cover more than one module --  expect to spend <em>more</em> than 10-15 hours per week on this course if you are in a late-start section.
<p>Being a full-time student is a full-time job, around 40+ hours per week for class and study time. I understand that for many community college students, attending college is a part of a very busy life.  Remember: You are responsible for your learning, and learning takes time.
<b>Time management is your friend or your foe! Waiting until the evening of the due date to ask a question of an assignment will not be your best approach for success for this class. Start assignments early and have time to reach the tutors and me with questions.</b>
<b class="t911"> No assignment will be accepted for grading after the last due date.</b>
</p>

<h4 id="Due-dates">&#x2714; Due dates (When is my stuff due?)</h4>
<p>
Assignments are due on time / date given at the Web site. Online postings are due by midnight of the due date or they will be late. You can post assignments any time during the current unit. Note, the upload must complete prior to the due date/time. Start early! Please do not wait until the last minute to post due to normal connectivity issues associated with the Internet.
<p><span class="t911">
All assignments MUST be posted before 11:59pm of the due date listed for a given unit using the appropriate posting for a given assignment. Assignments not posted in the appropriate form for a given unit will not be graded.
Any assignment other than a BoC submission not submitted by that time will be considered late and WILL NOT BE GRADED.</span>
<p>This applies to work submitted on MindTap, submitted on Canvas, or uploaded to cis2. In particular, do <em>not</em> update files on cis2 after the due date, or they will not be graded. MindTap submissions made after the due date will not be considered in determining your grade for MindTap work.
<p>Do not wait until the last minute to complete your assignments, coding takes as much "down time" as it does effort, and your instructor may not return your email until the next business day. Note: Emailed assignments will not be accepted for grading unless  previously approved by the instructor.
</p>
<p>
Only BoC submissions can be submitted late. BoC submissions can be submitted up to 5 days late, but this will result in a point deduction on the late BoC work (out of 90 points).</p>
<p>All other work is due on its assigned date. Note that discussion board posts are due on the board's due date, and responses (such as BoC reviews) are due on the board's "Available Until" date. Late posts are required in order to post reviews, however they will not be awarded points. Late responses are not permitted.</p>
<p>Late work will be graded at the discretion of the instructor as to when the assignment will be graded. This means you may not have feedback in a timely manner due to your late submission. Timely feedback is given to timely submissions.</p>
<p>Late work maybe permitted outside of this policy under very special circumstances in accordance with OC policies, such as accessibility needs, with appropriate documentation.
</p>

<h4 id="Form-Confirmations">&#x2714; Submission Confirmations (It is for your protection!)</h4>
<p>
When assignments are posted at the Web site, MindTap, or cis2, verify that it was submitted. For Canvas, go to the Grades tab and see if your work was registered there. For MindTap, check the Dashboard to see if your work was registered there. For cis2, check for your files through the browser after uploading them.
<p>This serves several purposes. It shows that your posting was accepted by the system and gives you an opportunity to verify the transaction. Since little or no paper is used in the class, your only documentation that you posted an assignment *is* the electronic gradebook. Please make a copy of your successful submission, either an electronic copy or printed a copy. Keep them safe in the event of a system failure and/or loss of postings at the class Web site. To date, loss of data is extremely rare but can happen since we are using the Internet for transmitting data. It is strongly recommend that you print out all your submission confirmations and place them into a confirmation notebook as your backup. Copies of your confirmations, except exams, can be found in the Grades section. If issues do arise, one of the first things I may ask to see is your submission confirmation. <b class="t911">Without a submission confirmation for an assignment, you may receive 0 points for an assignment.</b>
</p>

<h4 id="my-points">&#x2714; Monitor Your Progress (Don't let grades surprise you!)</h4>
<p>
You can monitor your unit progress by clicking on <b>Grades</b> on the site index as well as view what assignments you have posted to the class Web site.
We post grades ASAP, usually within 7 days.
A bit more during exams or if my schedule gets impacted.
My goal is to give reasonable feedback to as many students as possible in the shortest time possible.
If you have any questions, comments, concerns about an assignment, or would like detailed feedback, please feel free to use the Canvas Inbox on the left of most pages.
</p>

<h4 id="redo">&#x2714; Redo work (It is that important!)</h4>
<p>Occasionally I will suggest that an assignment be redone because it appears that the learning outcomes may not have been met regarding that assignment. <b class="t911">If a redo is suggested, a notice will posted in the Grades section in the comments area of your submission.</b>
You need to resend the requested redo assignment in the requested timeframe (typically 3 days, though it may differ for time-critical activities) after points are posted for that assignment or the redo will *not* be graded and the grade given will stand. Please contact us via the Canvas Inbox for instructions and support.
Please see Redo assignments as a courtesy and not as a right.
Redo work will be graded at the discretion of the instructor both for points as well as to when the assignment will be graded.
</p>

<h4 id="withdrawing">&#x2714; Withdrawing (What to do if you need to leave the class)</h4>
<p>
If you wish to withdraw from this course, please file the appropriate paperwork with the Office of Registration and Records and then inform me of your decision.
It is your responsibility to contact Registration and Records, otherwise you remain enrolled in the course.

or
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asperger_syndrome">asperger syndrome</a>).
Most disabilities at OC are invisible.
As an instructor, I can not disclose a student's disability.
The decision to share with others is a choice of the student.

<article id="Support"><h3>
&#x2605; Technical Support:
</h3><p>
When things go wrong with computing it is never fun, especially when there are due dates and other time sensitive demands.
Here are a few contacts and ideas to consider related to technical support:
</p><ul><li><b>Issues or questions about this site (olympic.instructure.com)</b><br/>
Please feel free to use your Canvas Inbox as a place to start with a brief description and the URL of the problem page.
If the Canvas Inbox is not functioning, please use my OC email account and please include the course, your name, the nature of the issue, and any files or links to help resolve it. On the Subject: line, please use CIS 155 | Your name | the issue. I will try to respond and update you ASAP.

Please develop a plan "B" in case you have issues with your normal Internet access and related software that might affect your ability to participate in this class like Internet outage at home, local power outages, or non-functioning computers.
</li></ul><ul><li><b>Start early and don't wait until the last hours of a due date!</b><br/>
Many things can impact your ability to be successful in a college class that has lots of dependance on computing and access to the Internet.
By starting early, you give yourself an extra buffer when things get a bit bumpy on the Information Highway like Websites bing down for a few hours for things like maintenance or technical issues or local issues like running out of paper or system updates.
These things happen as well as your education add additional demands and expectations to your probably already complex life.

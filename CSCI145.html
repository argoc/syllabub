                            Assessment</h3></header>
							<p>Assessment for the course consists of a midterm exam, a final exam, quizzes and labs at each course session, and three programming assignments. As stated in the University Bulletin, "A student who fails to take a final examination without making prior arrangements acceptable to the instructor receives a failing grade for the class."</p>
							
						<h4>Assignments</h4>
						<p>There are three assignments in this course; each is a significant program that you must develop on your own. Apply these guidelines.
						<ul>
						<li>When working out a problem, discussion with your classmates or seeing help can be very valuable. However, <strong>programs that you turn in for a grade must be your own.</strong> Students who copy programs or sections of programs from each other or from any other source will be considered to be cheating, as will students who allow their programs to be copied. See Academic Honesty below for more information.</li>
						<li>Programs must run on a lab machine. Any programming project that does not compile and run on a lab machine will be awarded a score of 0 points. In order to improve that score, students must spend enough time with the instructor to get the program running.</li>
						<li>Programs must be completely submitted before midnight the day they are due. Late programs are subject to a deduction of 10% each day from the maximum possible score. A program worth 100 points if submitted before midnight is only worth 90 points at 12:00 AM the second day. Programs will not be accepted more than 4 days late.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Programs will be graded on correctness, design, and style.</p>
						<h4>Labs</h4>
						<ul>
						<li>Each lab is hands-on. Attendance and work in class is expected. Labs start right away, the first day. Lab activities are used to build your programming skills for the assignments and exams.</li>
						<li>As this is a Poulsbo class, attendance at the Poulsbo labs is expected. You cannot substitute a Bellingham lab section.</li>
						<li>If you should miss a lab, do not expect the instructor to provide you with an equivalent session during office hours. Be prepared to go through the lab yourself, and if you still have specific questions, then ask your instructor. Late scoring will also apply to labs not completed the day they were assigned.</li>
						<li>During weeks when assignments are due, lab hours can be used to work on the assignments, and the instructor will be available to answer questions on the assignment. Note that assignments are expected to take additional time outside of the lab, do not expect to complete your assignment in only that lab time.</li>
						</ul>
						<h4>Quizzes</h4>
						<p>Quizzes will be given in class over assigned reading and material covered in class. Make-up quizzes will not be granted other than for exceptional reasons.</p>
                        <h4>Exams</h4>
						<p>The Midterm and Final are in-class. Make-up exams will only be given due to a serious emergency. If you must miss an exam, even if you are sick or injured, you must contact the instructor before the exam, or arrange for someone to do so. You must show evidence you were physically unable to take the exam for a make-up to be arranged. No special accommodations will be made for students who arrive late to exams, regardless of the reason (this includes car, bus, overslept, sick).</p>

                        <p>You will need to schedule sufficient time in the Poulsbo lab, or have regular access to a PC and have Eclipse Neon.3 and JDK 1.8u131 on a flash drive, to complete the coursework. We use Eclipse and the JDK to develop and run our code in this class.</p>
                        <p>You will need to have regular Internet access for completing and submitting coursework. <strong>You must have a plan "B" in case you have issues with your normal Internet access and related software that might affect your ability to participate in this class. Internet, network, computer or software issues will not change your due date.</strong></p>
						<p>It is your responsibility to be aware of the impact of your actions when using the internet, with respect to managing your privacy, using the information you access, and maintaining machine security.</p>

                                <p><em>First</em>, start assignments early and be proactive. If you need help, get help early - if you wait it can become too late.</p>
                                <p>I am available after class and via Canvas messages. If your question requires a conversation, we will use Skype if a mutual time can be arranged prior to the next class meeting. <strong>Do not use regular email, response will not be as quick as it is not monitored daily.</strong></p>
                                <p>You can expect a response from me to your Canvas Inbox message within one school day; do not expect a reply on weekends, breaks, or holidays. If you do not get a response, resend your message and check the to: address to ensure it is going to the appropriate person.</p>
                                <p><strong>Do not show your quiz, exam, lab or assignment work to your classmates or share it on the internet.</strong> The instructor will not, and other individuals must not directly provide any part of a solution to a home work assignment or lab.

                            <li id="effort"><b>Effort</b>: Regular attendance and success in this course have a strong correlation. Regular attendance means:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>You are logging in to the Canvas classroom at least three times per week. </li>
                                    <li>You are completing the reading prior to attending class. </li>
                                    <li>You are attending, taking notes, joining discussions, and asking questions during class. </li>
                                    <li>You have a plan B in place in case your internet access is interrupted, and use it. </li>
                                    <li>You make regular progress on the labs, assignments, and quizzes each week. </li>
                                    <li>You seek assistance promptly from the instructor when you have questions on the reading or any assignments. </li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>New concepts tend to build on previous concepts rather than stand on their own. Given the accelerated nature of this summer term, do not delay - even falling behind one lesson can be extremely damaging in your ability to complete the course. Utilize office hours to ask for assistance.</p>
                                <p>Students are expected to have the <a href="#TextRequired">Course Textbook</a> and satisfy the <a href="#expectations">Technical Expectations</a> on or before the start of class. Any requested reading or activity should be completed before the first class day of the module, so that the student can better participate in discussions and use lab time effectively. Not having a text and not being prepared will not be an acceptable excuse for not being able to participate in class. </p>
                                <p>By taking this course, you are stating that you will be making appropriate time in your schedule to ensure success and have access to the resources required for this class. <strong>Since this is a compressed quarter, expect to spend about 6 hours per week for each class credit to ensure success.</strong> For a 4 credit class this is 24 hours of class work per week. Java will be your life for the next 5 weeks - be prepared for the time commitment. </p>
                                <p>Remember: You are responsible for your learning. You need to invest regular, consistent time to succeed in this course.</p>
                                <p>Time management is your friend or your foe! Waiting until the evening of the due date to ask a question of an assignment will not provide success in this course. You may not get a response before the due date. That is your responsibility, you alone are responsible for your late start. Start assignments early and be proactive. </p>

                                <p><b>Academic honesty</b>: Academic dishonesty is defined in the University Catalog as misrepresentation by deception or by other fraudulent means which compromises an instructor's ability to fairly evaluate a student's work or achievement. It is the instructor's responsibility to confront a student and to take appropriate action if academic dishonesty, in the instructor's judgment, has occurred. Please refer to the University Catalog for further information. See <a href="https://wp.wwu.edu/academichonesty/" target="_blank">POL-U2100.02</a> for the official policy.</p>
								<p>Any student who violates the academic honesty policy will receive a grade of F for the course and a letter will be added to the student's permanent academic record.</p>
								<p>Academic dishonesty is dishonesty. In our setting, it is misrepresentation of others' work as your own, or providing your own work to others for their use. Academic dishonesty compromises the instructor's ability to fairly evaluate a student's work or achievement. It includes, but is not limited to, the following:
								</p>
								<ul>
								<li>Giving, taking, or receiving unauthorized information to/from another person during any type of assignment or test. You must not share your work, or ask others to provide you with any part of a solution to a lab, assignment, quiz, or exam.</li>
								<li>Obtaining or providing without authorization questions or answers prior to the time of an assignment or test.</li>
								<li>Using unauthorized sources for answers during any assignment or test. This includes code from StackOverflow, GitHub, or other sources.</li>
								<li>Taking part in or arranging for another person to complete an assignment or to take a test in place of another.</li>
								<li>Altering answers on a scored test and submitting it for a higher grade.</li>
								<li>Collaborating with others in a required assignment without the approval of the instructor.</li>
								<li>Stealing class assignments or portions of assignments, including electronic files, and submitting them as one's own.</li>
								<li>Plagiarism, which is presenting as one's own in whole or in part the argument, language, creations, conclusions, or scientific data of another without explicit acknowledgement. This includes such things as using a machine translation program, reusing your own work from another course, paraphrasing without citing a source, or claiming credit on work you did not do.</li>
								</ul>
								<p><strong>Facilitating academic dishonesty includes providing your own work to someone else for their solution</strong>; do not put your classmates in this situation, they must not provide you with solutions.</p>
                                <p>Unless otherwise noted your assignments are individual assignments and your work must be your own. At any point during the term, you should be able to explain or duplicate any of your solutions for your assignments. I reserve the right to refuse to accept any assignment if you cannot demonstrate the ability to perform similar work when asked, or if you cannot explain your answer or approach that you have used.</p>
                             
                            </li>
							<li id="appropriate"><b>Appropriate Collaboration</b>: It can be valuable to talk with a classmate then learning a new programming language or working out a problem. However, <strong>the work that you turn in for a grade must be your own.</strong> All aspects of the labs and assignments in this course are meant to be done individually.
							<p>To ensure this, after working together, no collaborators may keep any electronic or physical documents of the session. You may only keep your memories. This means that you may not ask for or give help on an assignment while sitting in front of a computer where the assignment is open.</p>

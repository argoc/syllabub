== Recording your class

* Panopto 
** In Canvas
** Strong Controls
** RSS feed!
** Navigate Videos without Streaming
* Blackboard Collaborate
** In Canvas
** Student Interaction
* Third Party
** Completely Control Rendering
** Richer Editing

== Panopto

* Include in course shell
* Check machine setup
* Choose what's in the recording
* Recording quality
* Other settings
* How to Record
* The Upload
* Fixing problems
* Student view
* Download recordings
* Embed recordings
* Adding subtitles
* And more...

== Include Panopto in Your Course Shell

* Settings
** Navigation
*** Slide Panopto up to the visible list
** SAVE to keep the navigation change
* Put reminders in each module ... more on this later

== Make sure Panopto is on your machine

* Panopto Recordings
** Create
*** Record a New Session
**** Launch Panopto
+
If nothing happens, Panopto is not installed on the machine (request through helpdesk@olympic.edu)
+
Panopto may require a login (use your Canvas/OC credentials)


== What's Recorded
** Primary Screen
** You (it's a good thing, really): audio and/or video
** Secondary Screen (not such a good thing...)
** PowerPoint (skippable)


== Quality of Recordings (1)

* Primary (webcam)
** video yes/no -- check lighting
** audio yes/no -- check sound strength (turn it UP)
** quality: affects head size and sound


== Sound quality depends on ...

* The HVAC
* What noise-generators are near your microphone (SURFACE PRO 3)
* Quality of your microphone (LG750 over LG760 and LG730)
* How far away you are from the microphone
** If you wander, get a bluetooth setup in the room -- but test sound again!
* Repeat the question! (students voices dim at best, off-mike)


== Quality of Recordings (2)

* Main Screen (monitor that is main display)
** fps = frames per second kbps - kb per second, impacts frame size
** screen resolution, fps, kbps interact to determine recording size; lower is smaller
** 15fps works for most screen use and ok corner webcam
** 30fps gives good webcam recording if full head-shot
** 1280x720 resolution captures 12-point fonts on full-size viewing; 16-point fonts viewable on phablets
(640x480 very small; 1920x1080 very large)
** bit rate control is new -- higher settings will give bigger files with more quality (it's always a trade-off); try 500kbps or max permitte
d for resolution.
* Second Screen (not recommended)


== Check settings

* choose folder (set to current class)
* recording name (defaults to a timestamp -- consider using date, class, module
* under settings->Advanced Settings, click "Capture in MP4 format" (it makes recovery of crashed recordings easier...)
* if no second monitor, under settings->Basic Settings, click "Minimize when recording"


== Record

* put Panopto controls on secondary screen
* the big red button
* Pause may not be your friend (check the recording if you use it; lost in re-rendering)
* You're on!
* When done, click the Green STOP button


== Upload

* Uploading goes on during the recording, but if there are network issues, it may not make it by the end of class.
* If it's not done, Coordinate with the next instructor in the room -- if they don't need Panopto, leave it running (lock your login but leave it up) so the upload continues
* If the next instructor uses Panopto, exit Panopto; otherwise they have to reboot to kill your Panopto to get theirs to start. Your upload will continue when they start Panopto 
* If you have to kill your upload, grab the MP4's for the screen and video/audio (MP3 if just audio) so you can upload them from another machine (I slide them to the Z drive)


== Failed Upload? 

* Use Panopto Recordings-> Create -> Upload Media to create a video from saved MP4's.
* Video/Audio is primary
* Screen is secondary


== Sound quality bad?

* wave a magic wand
* apologize
* re-record
* download primary, extract the audio into http://www.audacityteam.org/[Audacity], http://diyvideoeditor.com/cleaning-a-voice-track-with-audacity/[clean the audio], and then replace the primary track with the audio track 
** (or stitch the audio and video together with something like ActivePresenter....)



== What the students see

* The Panopto Experience
** streaming
** bookmarks/notes
** speed up/slow down/pause

* The RSS feed/podcast/downloaded videos


== Adjusting the "podcast"

* Style of layout 
 ** picture-in-picture
 ** just primary
 ** just secondary (includes audio)
 ** tile all (not recommended for reading screens)
* quality of podcast rendering
** 576p (30fps)
** 720p (30fps) <-- best compromise tablet v. PC
** 1080p (30fps) <-- PC, not streaming video (fine for computer use)
** 1080p (60fps) <-- PC, streaming video


== Reminding students

* Panopto in Course Navigation (not enough)
* Panopto reminder in Modules (use Text Header, not External URL)
* Panopto link in a Page always `https://olympic.instructure.com/courses/COURSENUMBER/external_tools/25250`
* Embed the video in a Page
* Show them the RSS shortcut


== Embed the Video in a page
 ** Panopto Recordings
 ** mouseover the ... by the video you want to bring up the admin menu
 ** select Settings
 ** select Share
 ** Select Embed
 ** Copy the `<iframe...` code in the text area
 ** return to the Page you want to put it on
 ** Click HTML Editor
 ** paste this HTML code on the page (put it at the top if you aren't HTML-comfortable, you can move it next)
 ** Click Rich Text Editor
 ** If you don't like where the video is, select it and cut-and-paste it where you want it on the page.


== The RSS shortcut for students
* Do this on FIREFOX
* Go to Panopto Recordings
* Click orange RSS icon
* Click "Subscribe to RSS" in the pop-up menu
* A page comes up with all of the currently available videos, most recent first -- students can click to view them or right-click and save them locally.
* Students can bookmark that link and return to it to see the videos later (they don't always have to go through these steps)


== Subtitles? (1)

* Need a https://matroska.org/technical/specs/subtitles/srt.html[.srt file]
** could use https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6373554[YouTube Generated Captions] but then you have to upload it to YouTube, get the captions, and export them ... and do you want your video on YouTube?
** could use software like https://www.techsmith.com/camtasia.html[Camtasia] to generate it; Camtasia is trainable to recognize _your_ voice 
** - http://www.etskb-fac.cidde.pitt.edu/panopto/best-practices-for-adding-captions-to-your-panopto-videos/[U. of Pittsburgh Best Practices on Adding Captions] gives YouTube directions and pointers to other software


== Subtitles? (2)
* Add the captions to your recording _after_ it is uploaded and processed:
** Panopto Recordings
 ** mouseover the ... by the video you want to bring up the admin menu
 ** select Settings
 ** select Captions
 ** Click Browse ... and pick the srt file
 ** Click Upload Captions


== Subtitles in Panopto
* Not included in the Podcast
* Stream on the side as the student views the recording
* https://olympic.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=e4440663-b19b-4f99-a187-bb7db5658493[Sample Subtitled Video]


== Other Panopto Tips

* cleaning up local videos through the app
* Editing in Panopto - limited, but can cut off a start/end
* Bookmarks/Notes can be published (won't be in the downloaded MP4s)
* Viewing statistics (won't register downloads, just views within the viewer)

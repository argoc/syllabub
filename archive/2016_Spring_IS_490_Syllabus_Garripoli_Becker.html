<p><strong>COURSE REQUIREMENTS:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Grading and Assignments</strong>:</p>
<p>Total points that can be earned are 700. Refer to Canvas assignment instructions for specific details.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Project Objectives&mdash;150 points</span></p>
<p>Students will develop at least four objectives for a significant project, to be completed in this term. These are to be submitted by Tuesday, April 11 in preparation for your first scheduled mentor session. These will be used to drive, track, and evaluate the finished project.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">10 journal entries&mdash;10 points each for 100 points</span></p>
<p>Beginning in module 1 and continuing throughout the course, students will post reflective and ongoing journal entries that document their professional development. Journal entries will be shared on your blog and reviewed by the instructor as a means of providing dialogue that will help guide the student through his or her experiences. These are due each Saturday.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">10 progress reports and mentor sessions&mdash;5 points each for 50 points</span></p>
<p>Students will prepare a written progress report and also spend 15-30 minutes each week with an instructor, reviewing their progress, issues they've hit, and their planned outcomes for their project. With a long, free-form goal of a large project, it is important to make regular, steady progress -- starting the project in the final week will not be sufficient. So, completing regular progress reports and mentor sessions that show the work is on target will be critical to ensuring your success. Prepare each report using the assignment description provided, prior to attending your weekly mentor session. Show up or Skype-in on time for your mentor session.  If you need to reschedule a mentor session, recognize that our schedules will be fairly full with the class's mentor sessions so it will be difficult to reschedule. Mentor sessions must be held in the week they are for. Your progress report is due on Tuesday at noon, each week.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Final Project&mdash;150 points</span></p>
<p>Based on self-provided objectives, students will complete a significant project, to be shared with the class. The completed project is due June 13.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Final Presentation&mdash;100 points</span></p>
<p>Students will prepare an oral presentation that encapsulates and summarizes their project. Presentations will involve the entire class and additional interested faculty and OC students. All IS students will be in the audience for presenters. Presentations are due June 7 or 14.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Final Report&mdash;150 points</span></p>
<p>Students will reflect on their project relative to its initial objectives and prepare a report detailing the success or shortfall of their results.</p>

<div><hr /></div>
<p><strong>EXPECTATIONS FOR SUCCESS:</strong></p>

<li>Take ownership for learning, and deliver quality products worthy of portfolio content. </li>
<li>Seek help immediately when problems or challenges arise.</li>
</ul>
<div><hr /></div>
<p id="submittingwork"><strong>SUBMITTING WORK:</strong></p>
<p>Journal entries must be blog posts; Google and Wordpress both offer free blogging services. Your blog must be public, so you can submit the Web URL of each blog post to Canvas for your journal entry and progress report assignments. You do not have to use your real name or an existing google account on your blog if you do not wish to.</p>
<p>All work must be submitted on Canvas. Ensure that all assignments are attached/deposited properly. It is your responsibility to ensure that all student submissions are in their proper place by their deadlines. Open a new browser window to check your submission, and do it early enough that you can resubmit before the due date if needed.</p>
<p>Submissions submitted on time will be graded within one week of their due date, unless we have heavier than normal professional obligations, in which case you will be notified of the delay. Your grade will be based on the content, quality, accuracy, and timeliness of your assignment.</p>
<div><hr /></div>
<p id="latepolicy"><strong>LATE POLICY:</strong></p>
<p>Lab discussions and activities must be participated in at the time they occur. If you cannot attend a lab, please contact us at least 24 hours prior to determine an appropriate alternative activity and completion time for it.</p>
<p>Canvas discussion posts and responses will not be accepted late. Successful discussions require timely interactions, so as a community you are required to participate, post and respond in a timely manner.</p>
<p>Progress reports and mentor sessions need to be completed in the week they are scheduled, as timely interaction is required to ensure steady progress on your
research. Rescheduling must be agreed upon with your assigned instructor no later than 24 hours prior to your regular meeting time.</p>
<p>Other work will only be accepted up to three weeks late, up to the last regular class meeting of the quarter. There is a 10% penalty per week for late work, prior to grading. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Work over three week late will not be accepted for grading.</span> No late work is accepted after the last regular class meeting for the quarter, even if it is less than three weeks away.</p>
<p>Any exceptions to this late policy must be agreed upon no later than 24 hours prior to the due date; exceptions will only be made with verifiable proof of your inability to do so (for example, an accident report or emergency hospital admission), no exceptions.</p>
<p>Late submissions will be graded at the instructor's discretion.</p>
<div><hr /></div>
<p><strong>GETTING HELP:</strong></p>
<p><em>First</em>, if you need help, get help early and often - if you wait until it is a crisis, it will be too late.</p>
<p>Here are some resources to get help in this class:</p>
<ul>
<li>Contact us through Canvas or email for help - please give sufficient detail, including which assignment you are asking about and your issue</li>
<li>Call or stop by during office hours - hours and number stated above. We are available outside of the listed hours by arrangement as well.</li>
<li>Bring up your issue in your weekly mentor session.</li>
<li><a href="http://libguides.olympic.edu/index">Haselwood Library</a> has an information kiosk that can aid you with searching databases, and getting interlibrary loans for books and journals.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://www.olympic.edu/services/tutoring-services/writing-center">Writing Center</a> offers assistance with writing online and by appointment.</li>
<li>BUS-106 will be available with a lab tech during class time and also at other times. A schedule will be posted on the course Canvas site once it is available.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you need help outside of class material, there are a wide variety of resources available to you. See <a href="http://www.olympic.edu/student-life/multicultural-and-student-programs/resources">Campus Resources</a> for assistance.</p>
<div><hr /></div>
<p><strong>GENERAL POLICIES:</strong></p>
<ol start="1">
<li><strong>Assignments</strong>: By taking this class, you are stating that you will be making appropriate time in your schedule to ensure success and have access to the resources required for this class. Research can be very time-intensive, so budget accordingly. Expect to spend 2-3 hours per week for every class credit to ensure success. That means this 5 credit class equals 10-15 hours outside of class per week to allow time for your success. Start assignments early, make steady progress, and be proactive.</li>
<ol start="1">
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Due dates:</span> Assignments are due on the date and time as noted in the Canvas classroom. Online postings are due by the time specified on the due date. You can post assignments any time during the current unit. Do not wait until the last minute to post, leave time for uploading and re-submitting work in case the first upload fails to complete. All assignments are due at or before the time specified on the due date listed for a given item using the appropriate dropbox. No assignment will be accepted for grading after the last scheduled day of classes. See the late policy for grading on late work.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Monitor Your Progress:</span> You can monitor your progress by going to the grades area in the Canvas classroom. Contact your instructor right away if you notice any discrepancies between an expected assignment grade and what is reported in the gradebook.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Deliverables:</span> You must do your own work; consultation with others is fine, but the end-products must be your work; don't copy the work of others.</li>
</ol>
<li><strong>Attendance</strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">:</span>  Regular progress is strongly recommended for success in this class. Senior Projects take steady progress; you will not be able to succeed in this class by doing a project in the final week. Check in with the Canvas shell on a regular basis each week and participate in all face-to-face meetings.</li>
<li><strong>Connectivity</strong>: Everyone experiences technical difficulties including the Canvas website, the K-20 network, your Internet service provider, and hardware issues. Have an alternate plan ready in the event of technical difficulties. Know where your local WiFi hotspots and computing resources are. There are labs on each Olympic College Campus. Please notify us
immediately if the issue cannot be handled by your alternate plan (i.e., wide area power outages or Canvas outages).</li>
<li><strong>Etiquette/Netiquette:</strong> This is a college level class. It is expected that the instructor and the students will be tolerant of others&rsquo; views, be respectful in dealing with others, and use standard professional English in their communications, both written and verbal. Refer to the applicable <a href="http://app.leg.wa.gov/wac/default.aspx?cite=132C-120">WAC</a> on student conduct. </li>
<li><strong>Email: </strong>Netiquette applies to email text as well. Please follow these guidelines:</li>
<ol>
<li>Send course email through Canvas, not to OC email. You will get faster turn-around, as Canvas takes priority during the term.</li>
<li>Use an appropriate Subject line, change it if you are starting a new topic in a reply. If you send multiple replies before we respond, note that we may not see the earlier replies due to the way Canvas presents messages.</li>
<li>We will respond to all Canvas messages within one business day during the term; on weekends, holidays, and breaks we are generally not checking messages and may not respond until the next business/contract day. If we have not answered your message within this timeframe, please re-send it and let us know.</li>
<li>Never assume email is private; others may be able to read or access your email, or it may be forwarded.</li>
<li>If you do send email about the course to our @olympic.edu email addresses, we generally aim to respond within 2 business days to emails from olympic.edu addresses during the term; on weekends, holidays, and breaks we are generally not checking email.</li>
<li>We cannot respond to student inquiries from non-olympic.edu email addresses. This is per OC policy. We can respond to all Canvas messages, and you can set Canvas up so it forwards messages to, and accepts replies from, your non-OC email.</li>
</ol>
</ol>
<div><hr /></div>
<h4><strong>ACADEMIC HONESTY:</strong></h4>
<p>Plagiarism and cheating are serious offenses and may lead to a failing assignment grade; failure in course; and or expulsion from the College. For more information refer to the <a href="http://www.olympic.edu/current-students/policies-processes/student-conduct-code">Student Code of Conduct</a>.  Academic dishonesty includes cheating, plagiarism, fabrication, and facilitating academic dishonesty. Facilitating academic dishonesty includes providing your own work to someone else for their solution; do not put others in this situation, they cannot provide you with solutions, only guidance. Fabrication includes making up sources that do not exist; you must be able to produce all of your sources if requested.</p>
<p>You are encouraged to work with one another to understand and discuss general concepts and approaches, but your work must be your own, and your writing must be in your own words. Except for team work, the assignments are to be completed individually, and as such you are expected to work on your own. We reserve the right to refuse to accept any assignment if you cannot demonstrate the ability to perform similar work when asked, if you cannot explain your answer or the approach that you have used, or if you cannot produce a source when requested. You need to develop and internalize the work yourself.</p>
<p>This is particularly important with your project -- whenever you use material from a source, that source must be immediately, properly cited and then a full reference supplied at the end of your paper/presentation. Please note: cut and paste of another's words or work is plagiarism. Quoting in a limited amount with a citation noted on the quote is permissible. Your words must be your own. Images and works must be appropriately sourced and cited as well, and must permit at least non-commercial re-use.</p>
<div><hr /></div>
<h4 id="disabilities"><strong>EQUAL OPPORTUNITY:</strong></h4>
<p>It is the policy of Washington's community and technical colleges to provide equal opportunity in education regardless of race, ethnicity, creed, color, national origin, sex, marital status, sexual orientation, age, religion, genetic information, gender identity, veteran status or the presence of any sensory, mental, or physical disability.  </p>
<div><hr /></div>
<h4><strong>DISABILITIES:</strong></h4>
<p>Olympic College is committed to providing equal access to students with disabilities.  Any student who feels he or she may need an accommodation based on the impact of a disability should contact Access Services in Room 205 of the Humanities &amp; Student Services Building, (360) 475-7540 or by email at <a href="mailto:AccessServices@olympic.edu">AccessServices@olympic.edu</a>. For more information visit <a href="http://www.olympic.edu/services/access-services-students-disabilities">Access Services</a>.</p>
<div><hr /></div>

<h4 id="success"><strong>SUCCESS:</strong></h4>
We want you to do well in this class and in college. If you have a problem or
situation that is affecting your schoolwork, please let us know. Olympic College
has many services to help students be successful. You can contact us by Canvas,
e-mail, voice mail, office hours, or talk to us right before or after class.

  <p>Your grade for the class will be assigned by converting your total of points to a
  percentage grade: Your total points will be multiplied by 0.1 to compute the percentage
  grade(see scale below).</p>
  <p>
  Example: Say Student Sally Sue earned a total of 900 points.</p>
  <p>
  900 * 0.1 = 90</p>
  <p>
  So, using the Percentage Grading Scale below, Sally Sue would receive a grade of 3.3. 
  Note however that the 3.3 (or any other
  grade) could be rounded down to a 3.2 or up to a 3.4 depending on how close the
  percentage grade falls to the upper or lower bounds. In addition, this rounding may
  take into account other factors such as Sally's attitude and participation.

  <h4 id="gradingnote">GRADING NOTE:</h4>

  <p>In order to receive a passing grade, students must spend considerable time outside
  the classroom working on projects, completing reading assignments, and performing
  additional research. Any student not able to make the commitment in time needed to be
  successful should consider auditing the class.</p>

  <p>In order to receive a passing grade, students can expect to spend about 12
  hours each week attending class/watching recordings, reading the text and working on the assignments.
  </p>
  
  <p>If you need help, get help before work is due. 
  Contact me for an appointment, I am available outside of office hours as well.</p>

  <p>All course work is expected to be done in a professional manner.</p>

  <div>

  </div>

  <h4 id="submittingwork">SUBMITTING WORK:</h4>

  <p>All work is submitted on Canvas in a Word 2007 or newer document. 
  Name the file with the Course Number, Lab Number, Last Name, and First Name.</p>
  <p>
  Example: CIS210_Lab3_Jones_Jill.docx
  </p>
  <p>
  The Word document should contain the following information at the top of the first page:<br/>
    Name: (e.g. John Doe)<br/>
    Date: (e.g. February 19, 2015)<br/>
    Course: (e.g. CIS 210)<br/>
    Assignment: (e.g. Lab 4) 
  </p>

  <p>Submissions will be graded within one week of being submitted, 
  those grades will be posted on Canvas.</p> 
  
  <p>See the LATE POLICY below.</p>

  <div>

  </div>

  <h4 id="participation">PARTICIPATION:</h4>
  
  <p>Your participation grade is based on classroom and/or online discussions. Each week, opportunities 
  will arise in class for interactive discussion. Those will be mirrored by Discussion Boards on Canvas,
  for Online students or those who choose not to participate in the classroom.</p>
  
  <p>On-ground participation scores will be posted by 9 pm Thursday evening.</p>
  
  <p>You will need to participate on ground or make a posting in response to the 
  weekly discussion by Saturday 11:59 pm for that
  week's participation grade. Of the 20 points, up to 15 will be awarded for your 
  initial substantive post, and up to 5 more for your
  substantive responses to at least one of your peers' posts. 
  Your response must enlarge upon, evaluate, constructively criticize or otherwise intelligently 
  add to the primary posting of your classmates.</p>
  
  <p>The following rubric will be used:</p>

  <h4 id="latepolicy">LATE POLICY:</h4>
  
  <p>Work turned in late will automatically have 5% of the points removed, per day late, prior to grading.
  <span style="color: #ff0000;">Work over one week late will not be accepted for
  grading.</span> No work is accepted after the last regular class meeting for the
  quarter.</p>
    
  <p>If unexpected circumstances arise (i.e. family or medical emergencies), contact 
  the instructor <em>before</em> the assignment due date/time to negotiate a mutually 
  agreed upon alternative submission plan in advance.</p>

<!--  <p>Make-up exams are available only upon arrangement <strong>prior</strong> to an exam
  date.</p>

  <h4 id="academichonesty">ACADEMIC HONESTY:</h4>

  <p>Plagiarism and cheating are serious offenses and may be punished by failure on exam,
  paper or project; failure in course; and or expulsion from the College. For more
  information refer to the 
  <a href="https://www.olympic.edu/StaffFaculty/Policies/ConductCode/">Student 
  Code of Conduct</a>.</p>

  <p>Unless otherwise noted your assignments are individual assignments and I expect that
  you will work on your own. At any point during the quarter, you should be able to
  explain or duplicate any of your solutions/answers for your assignments. I
  reserve the right to refuse to accept any assignment if you cannot demonstrate the
  ability to perform similar work when asked, or if you cannot explain your answer or
  approach that you have used. I encourage you to work with one another to
  internalize and discuss general concepts and approaches, but your work must be your
  own.</p>

  <h4 id="attendance">ATTENDANCE:</h4>

  <p>Attendance and success in this class have a strong correlation. New concepts tend to
  build on previous concepts rather than stand on their own. If you have to miss a class
  I suggest you view the available recording and network with other students to gather notes. I often hear the question,
  "I missed yesterday, did you cover anything important." My answer is always the same,
  "Yes." Utilize my office hours to ask for assistance. I am happy to make appointments outside of my
  listed hours.</p>

  <p>It is expected that students will be tolerant of others' views, be respectful in
  dealing with others, and use standard English in their communications, both written and
  verbal. Disruptive behavior will not be tolerated. Please review Olympic College's
  <a href="http://app.leg.wa.gov/wac/default.aspx?cite=132C-120">WAC 132C-120</a>
  policies. The various WACs have been passed by the state of Washington and are
  Washington State law that govern the behavior of the administration, faculty, and
  students.</p>

  <h4 id="learningmodes">LEARNING MODES:</h4>
 
  <p>This is a combined Web-Enhanced/Online class incorporating recorded presentations 
  in a classroom 
  in Bremerton and the online classroom in the Canvas Learning Management System. 
  Learning will be delivered in presentations, discussion, and projects. Assignments and 
  quizzes/exams must be submitted through Canvas.</p>
  
  <p>Have an alternate plan in case you have issues with your normal internet access 
  and related software and hardware that might affect your ability to complete this class. 
  Please notify me immediately if this is happening to you.  
  You may call me, send an email or use a school computer.</p>
 
  <p>It is expected that the student will have Microsoft Access 2010 or the ability to install
  it on their machine, and internet access. 
  A basic understanding of and manipulation of the Windows 7 interface is expected. 
  In particular, students should know how to use Windows Explorer to manipulate 
  (save, copy, delete, move, etc.) files, how to get access to the Internet, 
  how to use your browser, how to fill out Web forms, how to use email 
  (including attachments), and similar basic computer and Web skills.</p> 

  <p>If you do not feel comfortable with these basic skills, it is recommended that 
  you consider taking CIS 107 or CIS 150 prior to taking this class to build computer literacy.</p>

  <h4 id="withdrawing">WITHDRAWING:</h4>

  <p>If you wish to withdraw from this course, please inform me of your decision and file
  the appropriate paperwork with the Office of Registration and Records. If I have no
  data/grades to work with, an “F” will be given unless you have been in
  contact with me previously to make arrangements for an Incomplete; my understanding 
  is that this has an impact upon Veteran funding.</p>

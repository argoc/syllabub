</ul>
<p><strong>Grading and Assignments</strong>:</p>
<p>Total points that can be earned are 1000. Refer to Canvas assignment instructions for specific details.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">10 journal entries&mdash;20 points each for 200 points</span></p>
<p>Beginning in module 1 and continuing throughout the course, students will post reflective and ongoing journal entries that document their observations, thoughts, and progress. Journal entries will be shared on your blog and reviewed by the instructor as a means of providing dialogue that will help guide the student through his or her experiences. These are due each Sunday.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">8 research-related lab activities&mdash;25 points each for 200 points</span></p>
<p>Students will participate in discussions and lab activities for the first half of the term, and ongoing discussions of each others' research for the second half of the term. This will include open floor discussions relevant to their research and hands-on research-related activities. We're doing this rather than having online Canvas discussions so that you can participate in a free-flowing discussion not directly measured by word-count; however, you will each need to speak up and contribute. For some of you, this is easy; if you are a talker, encourage the more reticent to participate as actively as you rather than taking over the discussions. These are due at each lab night; the drop box for those with submissions remains open until midnight, but you will be given the opportunity to submit work during the lab. If you cannot attend a lab, please contact me at least 48 hours prior to determine an appropriate alternative activity.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">10 progress reports and mentor sessions&mdash;10 points each for 100 points</span></p>
<p>Students will prepare a written progress report and also spend 15-30 minutes each week with the instructor, reviewing their progress, issues they've hit, and their planned outcomes for their research. With a long, free-form goal of a large paper, it is important to make regular, steady progress -- starting the research in the final week will not be sufficient. So, completing regular progress reports and mentor sessions that show the work is on target will be critical to ensuring your success. Prepare each report using the assignment description provided, prior to attending your weekly mentor session. Show up or Skype-in on time for your mentor session. &nbsp;If you need to reschedule a mentor session, recognize that my schedule will be fairly full with the class's mentor sessions so it will be difficult to reschedule. You can reschedule a session to sooner than your normal one, if there is a slot available, without a late penalty being applied; any scheduled for later than your slot will have the penalty applied. Your progress report is due one hour before your mentor session each week.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">3 peer reviews&mdash;30/30/40 points respectively for 100 points</span></p>
<p>At the conclusion of the research, you will be reviewing 3 of your peers' research papers, 3 of your peers' publications, and all of the presentations. Submit a peer review for the assigned items on Canvas by filling out the rubric against that item for your peer and giving some concrete feedback based on your rubric scoring for them. Your scoring and feedback need to reflect upon each other, and also on the actual presentation delivered. All assigned reviews must be completed on time, the rubric filled out appropriately and matching, concrete feedback supplied to peer.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">White Paper&mdash;150 points</span></p>
<p>Based on research, data, and information gathered, students will prepare a professional white paper to be shared with the class. White paper content will reflect the student&rsquo;s own thinking, be grammatically correct, be fully cited, and follow standard guidelines for formatting&mdash;see instructions in the Canvas classroom for this assignment. White papers will undergo a peer review process. The original document is worth 100 points; the peer reviews will earn the remaining 50 points for this assignment. See the associated rubric for more information. The white paper is due June 8, so that it can be peer-reviewed in the final week. The peer review is due June 12.</p>
<p>As long as your paper satisfies the research paper rubric for this course, it may also be submitted as your capstone paper to your concurrent OLRM course or use substantial portions of work from your concurrent IS 438, Information Security II, course. I have checked the OLRM rubrics I had available to me in preparing my rubrics; if you are aware of any conflicts, please let me know so they can be adjusted to be compatible.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Presentation&mdash;150 points</span></p>
<p>Using the same research, data, and information gathering, students will prepare an oral presentation that encapsulates and summarizes their results. Presentations will involve the entire class and additional interested faculty and OC students. All IS students will be in the audience for presenters. Students will provide feedback for their peers. The original presentation is worth 100 points; the peer feedback is worth 50 points. See the associated rubric for more information. Presentations are due June 9 and will be delivered that week; sessions will be scheduled based on your availability, we will use additional evenings if needed (June 16 and 18).</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Publication&mdash;150 points</span></p>
<p>Using the same research, data, and information gathering for the report, students will prepare an original wiki entry to be posted online. Entries will be shared with and will be peer-reviewed by classmates. The original entry is worth 100 points; peer reviews are worth 50 points. See the associated rubric for more information. The publication is due June 15, and the peer review is due by June 18, the final day of finals week.</p>
<p>Your grade for the class will be assigned by converting your total points to a percentage grade (see scale below).</p>

<p><strong>EXPECTATIONS FOR SUCCESS:</strong></p>
<p>Please note the following guidelines and approaches to success in this course:</p>
<ul>
<li>Contribute to the class by attending regularly and engaging in discussions.</li>
<li>Set up a plan and actively pursue each research milestone to ensure you complete your final items on time.</li>
<li>Demonstrate a level of engagement through careful listening and attention to details and due dates.</li>
<li>Apply a professional level of communications throughout the course both verbally and in writing</li>
<li>Adhere to proper spelling, grammar and punctuation as if communicating in a professional setting.</li>
<li>Stay current with course materials and observe, read, and otherwise absorb course content.</li>
<li>Take ownership for learning, and deliver quality products worthy of portfolio content.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Seek help immediately when problems or challenges arise.</li>
</ul>
<div><hr /></div>
<p id="submittingwork"><strong>SUBMITTING WORK:</strong></p>
<p>Journal entries must be blog posts; Google and Wordpress both offer free blogging services. Your blog must be public, so you can submit the Web URL of each blog post to Canvas for your journal entry and progress report assignments. You do not have to use your real name or an existing google account on your blog if you do not wish to.</p>
<p>All work must be submitted on Canvas. Ensure that all assignments are attached/deposited properly. It is your responsibility to ensure that all student submissions are in their proper place by their deadlines. Open a new browser window to check your submission, and do it early enough that you can resubmit before the due date if needed.</p>
<p>Submissions submitted on time will be graded within one week of their due date, unless I have heavier than normal professional obligations, in which case you will be notified of the delay. Your grade will be based on the content, quality, accuracy, and timeliness of your assignment.</p>
<div><hr /></div>
<p id="latepolicy"><strong>LATE POLICY:</strong></p>
<p>Discussions that are held in the lab must be participated in at the time they occur. Canvas discussion posts and responses will not be accepted late. Successful discussions require timely interactions, so as a community you are required to participate, post and respond in a timely manner.</p>
<p>Work will only be accepted up to three weeks late, up to the last regular class meeting of the quarter. There is a 10% penalty per week for late work, prior to grading. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Work over three week late will not be accepted for grading.</span> No late work is accepted after the last regular class meeting for the quarter, even if it is less than three weeks away.</p>
<p>Any exceptions to this late policy must be agreed upon no later than 48 hours prior to the due date; exceptions will only be made with verifiable proof of your inability to do so (for example, an accident report or emergency hospital admission), no exceptions.</p>
<p>Late submissions will be graded with the next week's work.</p>
<div><hr /></div>
<p><strong>GETTING HELP:</strong></p>
<p><em>First</em>, if you need help, get help early and often - if you wait until it is a crisis, it will be too late.</p>
<p>Here are some resources to get help in this class:</p>
<ul>
<li>Contact me through Canvas or email for help - please give sufficient detail, including which assignment you are asking about and your issue</li>
<li>Call or stop by during my office hours - hours and number stated above. I am available outside of the listed hours by arrangement as well.</li>
<li>Bring up your issue in your weekly mentor session.</li>
<li><a href="http://libguides.olympic.edu/index">Haselwood Library</a>&nbsp;has an information kiosk that can aid you with searching databases, and getting interlibrary loans for books and journals.</li>
<li>The&nbsp;<a href="http://www.olympic.edu/services/tutoring-services/writing-center">Writing Center</a>&nbsp;offers assistance with writing online and by appointment.</li>
<li>BUS-106 will be available with a lab tech during class time and also at other times. A schedule will be posted on the course Canvas site once it is available.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you need help outside of class material, there are a wide variety of resources available to you. See&nbsp;<a href="https://www.olympic.edu/CampusResources/">Campus Resources</a>&nbsp;for assistance.</p>
<div><hr /></div>
<p><strong>GENERAL POLICIES:</strong></p>
<ol start="1">
<li><strong>Assignments</strong>: By taking this class, you are stating that you will be making appropriate time in your schedule to ensure success and have access to the resources required for this class. Research can be very time-intensive, so budget accordingly. Expect to spend 1-2 hours outside of class per week for every class credit to ensure success.&nbsp;That means this 5 credit class equals 9 hours outside of class per week to allow time for your success. Start assignments early and be proactive.&nbsp;</li>
<ol start="1">
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Due&nbsp;dates:</span> Assignments are due on time /&nbsp;date as noted in the Canvas classroom. Online postings are due by&nbsp;midnight of the due date. You can post assignments any time during the&nbsp;current unit. Please do not wait until the last minute to post.&nbsp;All assignments are due at or before the beginning of the class period or by11:59pm&nbsp;of the due date listed for a given item using the appropriate dropbox. &nbsp;No assignment will&nbsp;be accepted for grading after the last scheduled day of classes. See the late policy for grading on late work.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Monitor&nbsp;Your Progress:</span> You can monitor your progress by going to the grades area in the Canvas classroom. Contact your&nbsp;instructor right away if you notice any discrepancies between an expected&nbsp;assignment grade and what is reported in the gradebook.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Deliverables:</span>&nbsp;You must do your own work; consultation with others is fine, but the end-products must be your work; don&rsquo;t copy the work of others.</li>
</ol>
<li><strong>Attendance</strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">:</span>&nbsp; Regular progress is strongly recommended for success in this class. Research takes steady progress; you will not be able to succeed in this class by researching and writing a paper in the final week. Check in with the Canvas shell on a regular basis each week and participate in all face-to-face meetings.</li>
<li><strong>Connectivity</strong>:&nbsp;Everyone experiences technical difficulties including the Canvas website, the K-20 network, your Internet service provider, Have an alternate plan in the event of technical difficulties. Know where your local WiFi hotspots and computing resources are. There are labs on each Olympic College Campus.</li>
<li><strong>Etiquette/Netiquette:</strong> This is a&nbsp;college level class. It is expected that the instructor and the students will be tolerant of others&rsquo; views, be respectful in dealing with others, and use standard professional English in their communications, both written and verbal. Refer to the applicable <a href="http://app.leg.wa.gov/wac/default.aspx?cite=132C-120">WAC</a> on student conduct.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Email: </strong>Netiquette applies to email text as well. Please follow these guidelines:</li>
<ol>
<li>Send course email through Canvas, not to my OC email. You will get faster turn-around, as Canvas takes priority during the term.</li>
<li>Use an appropriate Subject line, change it if you are starting a new topic in a reply. If you send multiple replies before I respond, note that I may not see the earlier replies due to the way Canvas presents messages.</li>
<li>I will respond to all Canvas messages within one business day during the term; on weekends, holidays, and breaks I am generally not checking messages and may not respond until the next business/contract day. If I have not answered your message within this timeframe, please re-send it and let me know.</li>
<li>Never assume email is private; others may be able to read or access your email, or it may be forwarded.</li>
<li>If you do send email about the course to me at agarripoli@olympic.edu, I generally aim to respond within 2 business days to emails from olympic.edu addresses during the term; on weekends, holidays, and breaks I am generally not checking email.</li>
<li>I cannot respond to student inquiries from non-olympic.edu email addresses. This is per OC policy. I can respond to all Canvas messages, and you can set Canvas up so it forwards messages to, and accepts replies from, your non-OC email.</li>
</ol>
</ol>
<div><hr /></div>
<p><strong>ACADEMIC HONESTY:</strong></p>
<p>Plagiarism and cheating are serious offenses and may lead to a failing assignment grade; failure in course; and or expulsion from the College. For more information refer to the <a href="http://www.olympic.edu/current-students/policies-processes/student-conduct-code">Student Code of Conduct</a>.&nbsp; Academic dishonesty includes cheating, plagiarism, fabrication, and facilitating academic dishonesty. Facilitating academic dishonesty includes providing your own work to someone else for their solution; do not put others in this situation, they cannot provide you with solutions, only guidance. Fabrication includes making up sources that do not exist; you must be able to produce all of your sources if requested.</p>
<p>You are encouraged to work with one another to understand and discuss general concepts and approaches, but your work must be your own, and your writing must be in your own words. Except for team work, the assignments are to be completed individually, and as such you are expected to work on your own. I reserve the right to refuse to accept any assignment if you cannot demonstrate the ability to perform similar work when asked, if you cannot explain your answer or the approach that you have used, or if you cannot produce a source when requested.&nbsp;You need to develop and internalize the work yourself.</p>
<p>This is particularly important with your research -- whenever you use material from a source, that source must be immediately, properly cited and then a full reference supplied at the end of your paper/presentation.&nbsp;Please note: cut and paste of another's words is plagiarism. Quoting in a limited amount with a citation noted on the quote is permissible. Your words must be your own. Images must be appropriately sourced and cited as well.</p>

<h4 id="grades">GRADES:</h4>
<p>Your assignments for the course will be graded using the following point system:</p>

<p>Your grade for the class will be assigned by converting your total of points to a percentage grade: Your total points will be multiplied by 0.1 to compute the percentage grade (see scale below).</p>
<p>Example: Say Student Sally Sue earned a total of 900 points.</p>
<p>900 * 0.1 = 90</p>
<p>So, using the Percentage Grading Scale below, Sally Sue would receive a grade of 3.3. Note however that the 3.3 (or any other grade) could be rounded down to a 3.2 or up to a 3.4 depending on how close the percentage grade falls to the upper or lower bounds. In addition, this rounding may take into account other factors such as Sally's attitude and participation.</p>

<h4 id="gradingnote">COURSE WORK:</h4>
<p>This course requires completion of:</p>
<ol>
<li>Weekly Discussion Forum Entries and Participation</li>
<li>Weekly Course Chapter Quizzes</li>
<li>MS Project Exercise</li>
<li>Final Project</li>
</ol>
<p>In order to receive a passing grade, students must spend considerable time each week reading the text, exploring related material, and completing assigned tasks as listed above. Students can expect to spend about 12-16 hours each week on this course. Any student not able to make the commitment in time needed to be successful should consider auditing the class.</p>
<p>If you need help, get help before work is due. Contact me for an appointment, I am available outside of office hours as well.</p>
<p>All course work is expected to be done in a professional manner.</p>
<div><hr /></div>
<h4 id="submittingwork">SUBMITTING WORK:</h4>
<p>All work submitted on Canvas must use this file naming convention. Name the file with the Course Number, Item Type and Number, Last Name, and First Name.</p>
<p>Examples: CIS190_Module1_Jones_Jill.docx, CIS190_MSProject_Jones_Jill.dox, CIS190_FinalProject_Jones_Jill.docx</p>
<p>Each Word document should contain the following information at the top of the first page:<br /> Name: (e.g. John Doe)<br /> Date: (e.g. February 19, 2015)<br /> Course: (e.g. CIS 190)<br /> Assignment: (e.g. Module 1 Writeup)</p>
<p>Submissions will be graded within one week of their due date or when submitted if late, with grades posted on Canvas.</p>
<div><hr /></div>
<h4 id="latepolicy">LATE POLICY:</h4>
<p>Work turned in late will automatically have 10% of the points removed, per day late, prior to grading. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Work over one week late will not be accepted for grading.</span> No work is accepted after the last regular class meeting for the quarter, except for the final projects and optional quiz.</p>
<p>If unexpected circumstances arise (i.e. family or medical emergencies, military or service obligations), contact the instructor <em>before</em> the assignment due date/time to negotiate a mutually agreed upon alternative submission plan in advance.</p>
<p>Make-up exams are available only upon arrangement <strong>prior</strong> to an exam date.</p>
<div><hr /></div>
<h4 id="academichonesty">ACADEMIC HONESTY:</h4>
<p>Plagiarism and cheating are serious offenses and may be punished by failure on exam, paper or project; failure in course; and or expulsion from the College. For more information refer to the <a href="https://www.olympic.edu/StaffFaculty/Policies/ConductCode/">Student Code of Conduct</a>.</p>
<p>Unless otherwise noted your assignments are individual assignments and I expect that you will work on your own. At any point during the quarter, you should be able to explain or duplicate any of your solutions/answers for your assignments. I reserve the right to refuse to accept any assignment if you cannot demonstrate the ability to perform similar work when asked, or if you cannot explain your answer or approach that you have used. I encourage you to work with one another to internalize and discuss general concepts and approaches, but your work must be your own.</p>
<div><hr /></div>
<h4 id="attendance">PARTICIPATION:</h4>
<p>It is expected that you will maintain effort during the term, making regular contributions to each week's discussion forum and submitting work regularly. You may work ahead, however all work must be completed and will be graded to the same standard as work turned in on time.</p>
<p><strong>Discussions</strong> are designed to develop substantive conversations on topics relevant to project management. The discussions will require posting an initial post by each Thursday and two substantive responses by each Sunday. They should encompass the assigned reading, independent research, and your own relevant life experiences.</p>
<p><strong>Assessments</strong> are open book. However reviewing the material prior to taking the Assessments will greatly decrease the time required to take them. Assessments are not timed and can be stopped and picked up where you left off if you need to save it and come back to finish later. You may take an Assessment up to three times. You highest score will be used in grading the Assessment.</p>
<p><strong>MS Project Exercise</strong> One exercise involving MS Project will be submitted. You will have several weeks to complete the assignment, though you should plan accordingly. You will need to have this completed before beginning the final group project, since it assumes familiarity with MS Project.</p>
<p><strong>Final Project </strong> There will be one final group project to complete. It will involve a scenario, where students will act as an employee of a fictitious company to follow through on a project proposal applying practices learned in the course. More information about this can be found in the group project web page in the course site. Review the requirements for this project early. It will take several team meetings and individual work to complete this project and you should plan to make regular progress on it once it has begun.</p>
<p>Utilize my office hours to ask for assistance. I am happy to make appointments outside of my listed hours.</p>
<p>It is expected that students will be tolerant of others' views, be respectful in dealing with others, and use standard English in their communications, both written and verbal. Disruptive behavior will not be tolerated. Please review Olympic College's <a href="http://app.leg.wa.gov/wac/default.aspx?cite=132C-120">WAC 132C-120</a> policies. The various WACs have been passed by the state of Washington and are Washington State law that govern the behavior of the administration, faculty, and students.</p>
<div><hr /></div>
<h4 id="learningmodes">LEARNING MODES:</h4>
<p>This is an Online class incorporating recorded presentations and the online classroom in the Canvas Learning Management System. Learning will be delivered in presentations, discussion, and projects. Assignments and exams must be submitted through Canvas.</p>
<p>Have an alternate plan in case you have issues with your normal internet access and related software and hardware that might affect your ability to complete this class. Please notify me immediately if this is happening to you. You may call me, send an email or use a school computer.</p>
<p>It is expected that the student will have MS Project 2013, or the ability to install it on their machine, and internet access. It is available on the machines in the <a href="https://www.olympic.edu/CampusResources/ComputerLabs/">on-campus computer labs</a>&nbsp;including&nbsp;TEC-213, TEC-205, and the Tutoring Lab.</p>
<p>A basic understanding of and manipulation of the Windows interface is expected. In particular, students should know how to use Windows Explorer to manipulate (save, copy, delete, move, etc.) files, how to get access to the Internet, how to use your browser, how to fill out Web forms, how to use email (including attachments), and similar basic computer and Web skills.</p>
<p>If you do not feel comfortable with these basic skills, it is recommended that you consider taking CIS 107 or CIS 150 prior to taking this class to build computer literacy.</p>
<div><hr /></div>
<h4 id="withdrawing">WITHDRAWING:</h4>
<p>If you wish to withdraw from this course, please inform me of your decision and file the appropriate paperwork with the Office of Registration and Records. If I have no data/grades to work with, an &ldquo;F&rdquo; will be given unless you have been in contact with me previously to make arrangements for an Incomplete; my understanding is that this has an impact upon Veteran funding.</p>

<td valign="top">Total points</td><td class="ralign">500</td><td></td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<h4>SMART Objectives</h4>
<p>You will need to develop a list of objectives for yourself; this list is due the first week of the course and is used to measure your progress and outcomes in the course. The SMART rubric is recommended for developing these:
<ul>
<li>S :: Specific
</li><li>M :: Measurable
</li><li>A :: Achievable
</li><li>R :: Relevant
</li><li>T :: Time-bound
</li>
</ul>
More information about this rubric is available <a href="http://www.iom.edu/About-IOM/Making-a-Difference/Community-Outreach/~/media/Files/About%20the%20IOM/SmartBites/Planning/P1%20SMART%20Objectives.ashx">here</a>.</p>
<p>We use the Cooperative Work Experience Learning Objectives sheet, even for non-coop projects. This sheet is available in the Canvas course shell. For each credit you plan to receive, identify at least one objective, the list of
steps you plan to take to achieve those objectives, and specify how the results can be measured.</p>

<h4>Weekly Progress Reports</h4>
<p>Each week, you will need to complete and submit a progress report. This report is due each Saturday of the term. It can be submitted as a Word document, blog link, or cut-and-pasted into the Canvas drop box for the week.</p>
<p>Each status report needs to contain:
<ul>
<li>Hours worked on the project that week.
<li>Expected progress for the week vs. actual progress for the week.
<li>Issues that arose, and how they were/will be addressed.
<li>Expected progress next week.
</ul>
<p>Your report needs to relate your progress to your original objectives. It is important to show steady effort and progress toward their completion.</p>

<h4>Final Deliverables</h4>
<p>
If your CIS Practicum included any deliverable items (e.g. the .html files for a website that you designed, a how-to document on virtualization, a proof-of-concept paper on the deployment of TCP/IP version 6, etc.), then upload proof of those deliverable items (or the deliverable items themselves), in a compressed format (i.e. .zip, .7z, .tar, .gz, or other), to the Final Deliverables Drop Box located within the Final Module.
</p>
<h4>Final Report</h4>
<p>Your Final Report reflects upon the objectives, in a detailed way, that you submitted at the beginning of this course. Reference that document in your final report, and show how the outcomes were mastered, or where your work fell short. Evaluate your results against those original objectives. Be specific and concrete, and measure your work as minimal/acceptable/exceeds/superior mastery for each objective per the grading scale below.</p>
<p>Your final report should detail what was accomplished by you during your practicum, what you learned that was new during your practicum, and to what degree you feel that you have met with each of the original objectives that you wrote for your practicum.</p>
<p>In order to get full credit for your practicum this final report must be submitted into Canvas by 5pm Thursday June 16, 2016.</p>

</article>
<article id="Grading"><h3><i class="fa fa-tachometer"></i> 
Grading
</h3><p>
There are 500 possible points in this class. A minimum of 300 points are required for a grade.
Without prior arrangement, I will record a grade of '0.0' if your points are below 300 points. 
If a student fails the course or is given a NC, WP or WF, the instructor must report a last attended date. 
It is my understanding that this date can have implications for some sources of funding. 
In this course the date the student last submitted work accepted for grading will be used as the 
last attended date.</p>
<p>See chart below for details.</p>
<table cellpadding="5" border="1" style="border-collapse: collapse;">
<tr><th>Letter</th><th>GPA</th><th>Points</th><th>Percent</th><th>Qualitative Definition</th></tr>
<tr><td>A</td><td>4.0</td><td>480</td><td>96%</td><td>Superior course outcomes mastery</td></tr>

<p>Points on work submitted on-time are usually posted seven (7) days after the 
due date. 
If I have a larger than normal grading load, I will notify you of any 
delays in grading.

<article id="Expectations"><h3><i class="fa fa-keyboard-o"></i> 
Technical Expectations
</h3><p>
This course uses computers and the language of computers. You are expected to be 
comfortable using a computer, particularly the Windows operating system; a web 
browser; e-mail; and the Canvas Learning Management System.</p>
<p>This course requires 
that you be self-directed and able to resolve technical issues on your own.
You will be developing your technical skills as you work to meet your objectives.
</p><p>
It is expected that you have regular access to a Windows PC with Firefox
or newer installed, or administrator privileges so that you can install them. 
If you do not, you can install portable versions of Firefox on a flash drive.
</p>
<p>It is expected that you will have regular Internet access for 
submitting coursework.
<span class="important">
Please develop a plan "B" in case you have issues with your normal Internet 
access and related software that might affect your ability to participate in this class.
</span>
Computer labs are available at all OC campuses. See <a href="http://www.olympic.edu/services/computer-labs" target="_new">Computer Labs</a> 
on the OC website for their locations and hours. All PC labs have Firefox on the machines.

<li id="help"><b>Ask for help</b>:  
  <p><em>First</em>, if you need help, get help early and often - if you wait it can become too
  late. I am available to help you.</p>

<p>If you need assistance or are having problems in this class, please contact me via skype, Canvas, or email for assistance. We can schedule an online meeting if needed, or exchange messages.
The best way to contact me electronically is to use 
your Canvas Inbox. Canvas' Inbox is where I expect to locate student 
questions. All other methods will take longer and will not keep a centralized location for all our correspondence 
to assist with documentation. I monitor Canvas throughout the weekday during the term except on holidays.
</p><p>If you do contact me through Canvas for help - please give sufficient detail, for example,
by pasting the source code in question into the
body of the message and explaining what is happening. The subject needs to identify the topic or lab it is for;
references to past labs will not get prioritized so be sure to use the correct subject line. 
Stacking multiple messages to me with the same subject line may cause earlier ones to be disregarded, as Canvas displays the most recent one first.
</p><p>
I recommend that you do not use Canvas comments on your submissions except at the time you submit;
Canvas does not send notifications of comment updates, so they will not be seen as quickly
as Canvas Inbox messages.
</p><p>You can expect a response from me to your Canvas Inbox message within one business day; do not expect a reply on weekends, breaks, or holidays.</p>
<p>
If we need to use email, I will use your Olympic College email account. Email from non-olympic.edu addresses will be ignored per OC policies.
More information on OC email student accounts can be found at: 
<a href="http://www.olympic.edu/Students/StudentEmail" target="_new">http://www.olympic.edu/Students/StudentEmail</a>. Please ask for help
in a CIS lab if you have not been able to access your OC email account.
</p><p>If for some reason you have to use email (Canvas is preferred), 
    the subject line of your email must include the class, your name, and the topic, like so: <code>CIS 298 | Jane Jones | Week 4 progress blocked</code>. 
    Email messages with that subject line format will be responded to within one business day during the term. Other subject lines may not be noticed
    until I am catching up on older emails.</p></li>
<p>There are no programming tutors during summer term; I am your main resource for assistance with course materials beyond your own study.</p>
<p>The roll of the tutors and instructor is to assist the student in general approaches to problem 
solving, internalizing core concepts, and understanding constructs of a particular 
language. We review homework only to determine which topics 
require additional attention or review by the student so that they can 
be successful. We do not directly provide any part of a solution to a 
home work assignment. The work must be the student's own. Tutors are required to report 
students that request help outside of tutoring hours or that request help directly 
completing a home work exercise to the instructor for the class they are seeking help with.</p>

<p>If you need help outside of class material, there are a wide variety of resources available to you.
See <a href="http://www.olympic.edu/services" target="_new">Student Services</a> for assistance.</p>
</li>

<li id="etiquette"><b>Etiquette</b>:  
It is expected that students will show common courtesy, be tolerant of others' views, be respectful in dealing with others, 
and use standard English in their communications, both written and verbal. 
<p>You are expected to behave in a professional manner, and will be held to a
standard of professional etiquette.
<span class="important">Students who violate proper Etiquette may be administratively dropped from the course.</span>
</p>
</li>

<li id="wac"><b>WAC</b>:  
Please review Olympic College's 
<a href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/wac/default.aspx?cite=132c" target="_new">WAC 132C</a>
policies. The various WACs have been passed by the state of Washington and are Washington State law that govern the behavior of the administration, faculty, and students.
 </p></li>
 
 <li id="identification"><b>Identification</b>: 
All assignments must have your student name, assignment name, course and date clearly labeled. 
Please see the course website for the name of the assignment. Failure to follow this policy may result in the deduction of points on the assignment. 
</p></li>

<li id="preparation"><b>Preparation</b>:
Students are expected to be self-directed in this course and prepared to discuss their
progress at any point throughout the term.
Any requested reading or activity should be completed when requested,
so that the student can better participate in discussions and use
lab time effectively.
Not being prepared or having a technical/technology issue will not be an acceptable 
excuse for not being able to participate in discussions
or to turn in assignments on time.
</p></li>

<li id="assignments"><b>Assignments</b>:  
By taking this class, you are stating that you will be making appropriate time in your schedule 
to ensure success and have access to the resources required for this class. 
<strong>Expect to spend 3 hours per week for each class credit to ensure success.</strong> 
Example: 2 credit class = 6 hours of class work per week. This is a capstone course, 
and as such you are expected to set and meet objectives that require this level of effort.
</p><p>Remember: You are responsible for your learning. 
You may be administratively withdrawn from class if you do not demonstrate participation 
within the first two weeks of the term or for more than three consecutive weeks.
Participation is measured by access to the course shell on Canvas. 
You needs to invest regular, consistent time to succeed in this class.
<P>Since this is a self-directed course, late assignments will not be accepted. All assignments must be submitted by their due date. They can be submitted prior to their due date, if 
circumstances make you unable to submit them on the day. Regular, consistent progress is expected
throughout the term for this course.
 </p></li>
 
 <li id="duedates"><b>Due dates</b>:  
Assignments are due on time, the date for each is given on the course Canvas site. 
Online postings are due by 11:59 p.m. of the due date or they will be late, unless noted otherwise. 
You can post assignments any time during the term. 
Please do not wait until the last minute to post your work -- expect connectivity issues with Internet access and plan accordingly.
<span class="important">
All assignments must be posted by the time prescribed (usually 11:59pm) of the due date listed for a given item using the appropriate posting for a given assignment to be considered as on-time.
Any assignment not submitted by there specified time will be considered late.
</span> 
Do not wait until the last minute to complete your assignments; that will not be excused. 
Note: Emailed assignments will not be accepted for grading unless specified as part of an assignment or previously approved.
<span class="important">No late assignments will be accepted.</span> This includes the final project -- if you are having technology issues, you must find a way to contact me to let me know so that we can arrange for your completed project to be submitted on time.
 </p></li>
 
 <li id="confirm"><b>Submitting Work</b>:  
When assignments are posted at the Web site, using the form provided, 
Canvas will tell you if it succeeded or failed. I strongly recommend 
returning to the page in another browser window to verify that the 
Discussion Post or File Submission was successfully completed. Since little or no 
paper is used in the class, your only documentation that you posted an assignment 
is the successful completion of a submission on Canvas. Please save your files 
and make screenshots of the successful submission. Keep them safe in the event 
of a system failure and/or loss of postings at the class Web site. To date, loss 
of data is extremely rare but can happen since we are using the Internet for 
transmitting data and software to save it at the far end. It is strongly recommend 
that you print out all your form 
confirmations and place them into a confirmation notebook as your backup. 
If issues do arise, one of the first things I may ask to see is your submission 
confirmation. <span class="important">Without a submission confirmation for an assignment, 
you may receive 0 points for an assignment.</span>
</p>
<p>All requirements must be met for your submission to be accepted for grading. Follow
the directions provided in the assignment box to ensure all naming conventions, files requested, 
information requested, and formats requested are provided. Rubrics are also provided so you can further check
your work prior to submitting it.</p></li>

<li id="latework"><b>Late work</b>:  
Late assignments are not accepted for this course.
<p>If you have a <span class="important">one time event</span> that is a serious illness or accident, or active duty 
for you, your parent, your spouse, or your child, the late policy may be waived.
You must make  your request through Canvas at least one full day before the assignment 
is due for a late policy waiver or have verifiable proof of your inability to make the request by that time. 
Verification will be required and must be attached to your request. 
Vacations, colds, or other discretionary activities will not be accepted. 
On-going or pre-existing situations can not be used for reasons for late work since 
they were known constraints at the start of the class. 
</p><p>A late assignment is a one time event, and any excused late points will not transfer to additional assignments.
You will need to catch up with the course schedule and continue on time.
If for some reason you cannot catch up, you can contact Registration &amp; Records to withdraw; it is not
sufficient to tell me that you are withdrawing.
</p></li>

<li id="withdraw"><b>Withdrawing</b>: 
If you wish to withdraw from this course, please file
the appropriate paperwork with the Office of Registration and Records and then inform me of your decision.
If you are still in the gradebook at the end of the term,
your computed grade with 0's for unsubmitted work will be used unless you have been in
contact with me previously to make other arrangements. 
It is your responsibility to contact Registration and Records,
otherwise you remain enrolled in the course.
</p></li>

<li id="redo"><b>Redo work</b>:  
Occasionally I will request that an assignment be redone in whole or in part because it appears that 
the learning outcomes may not have been met regarding that assignment. 
If a redo is requested, a notice will posted in the Comments section of the 
assignment along with the current grade.
You need to resend the requested redo assignment within 3 days of the request,
or one week from the original due date, whichever is later. However, redo work 
will not be accepted after the last lecture day of the term. If not submitted in
a timely fashion, the redo will not be graded and the original grade in Canvas will stand. 
Please contact me via Canvas or during my office hours for instructions and support.
</p></li>

<li id="honesty"><b>Academic honesty</b>:  
No academic dishonesty will be tolerated, see 
<a href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/WAC/default.aspx?cite=132C-120-065" target="_new">WAC 132C-120-065</a>. 
Academic dishonesty includes cheating, plagiarism, fabrication, and facilitating academic dishonesty.
Facilitating academic dishonesty includes providing your own work to someone else for their solution; 
do not put the tutors or your classmates in this situation, they cannot provide you with solutions, 
only guidance and explanations.
Evidence of academic dishonesty will result in a forfeiture of points for an assignment.
Continued violations may result in a student being administratively withdrawn from this class. Academic dishonesty will be reported to the campus administration.</p>
<p>Unless otherwise noted your assignments are individual assignments and I expect that
your work will be your own. At any point during the term, you should be able to
explain or duplicate any of your solutions for your assignments. I
reserve the right to refuse to accept any assignment if you cannot demonstrate the
ability to perform similar work when asked, or if you cannot explain your answer or
approach that you have used. I encourage you to work with one another to
internalize and discuss general concepts and approaches, but your work must be your
own. This includes work with the tutors -- you cannot ask them to provide you with correct syntax
and exact solutions, they can only guide you. You need to develop and internalize the solution yourself.</p>
<p>Please note: cut and paste of another's words is plagiarism. Quoting in a limited amount with a citation noted on the quote is permissible. 
Your words must be your own.</p>
</li>

<li id="attendance"><b>Attendance</b>:
Attendance and success in this class have a strong correlation. For this course, attendance means making consistent progress each week toward your objective. 
Utilize my office hours to ask for assistance. I am happy to make appointments outside of my
listed hours.</p>
</p></li>

<li id="military"><b>Service members</b>: 
I will try to work with service members (military, police, fire, and alike) as best 
possible to enable you to complete this class. You must notify me through Canvas before any 
special accommodations will be made that explains your special situation that 
may temporarily impact your ability to participate in this class. Please note 
that all assignments are open from the start of the term. If you know of an 
upcoming situation, please take advantage of this opportunity before requesting accommodations.
</p></li>

Accommodations
</h3>
<p>Any student who feels they may need an accommodation based on the impact of a
  disability should contact the Access Services office in 
  <a href="http://apps.olympic.edu/CampusMap/?b=HSS" target="_new">HSS 205</a>, 
  by email at <a href="mailto:AccessServices@olympic.edu">AccessServices@olympic.edu</a> 
  or by phone at (360) 475-7540. More information may be found on 
  <a href="http://www.olympic.edu/AccessServices" target="_new">the Access Services website</a>. 
  Access Services must be contacted at least two weeks before the accomodation is needed.</p>
<p>
Please contact me via Canvas or see me during my office hours concerning your accommodation request(s)
after you have submitted them to Access Services,
so we can meet your needs in class.
</p><p>
Note that about 10% of all OC students have some type of disability, both observable (like the use of a cane) as well as invisible (like 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posttraumatic_stress_disorder" target="_new">PTSD</a>
or 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asperger_syndrome" target="_new">asperger syndrome</a>). 
Most disabilities at OC are invisible.
As an instructor, I cannot disclose a student's disability. 
The decision to share with others is a choice of the student.

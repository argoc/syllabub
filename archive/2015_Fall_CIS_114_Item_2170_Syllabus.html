Grading
</h3><p>
There are 200 possible points in this class. A minimum of 120 points are required for a grade.
Without prior arrangement, I will record a grade of '0.0' if your points are below 120 points. 
If a student fails the course or is given a NC, WP or WF, the instructor must report a last attended date. 
It is my understanding that this date can have implications for some sources of funding. 
In this course the date the student last submitted work accepted for grading will be used as the 
last attended date.</p>
<p>See chart below for details.</p>

<p>Points on work submitted on-time are usually posted seven (7) days after the 
due date. If I have a larger than normal grading load, I will notify you of any 
delays in grading.
See <a href="#Policies">Policies</a> for information on submitting work, the late 
policy, academic honesty and more.</p>

Technical Expectations
</h3><p>
This course uses computers and the language of computers. You are expected to be 
comfortable using a computer, particularly the Windows operating system; a web 
browser; e-mail; and the Canvas Learning Management System. You will be expected 
to download and install software, download and unzip files, 
create text documents in simple text editors, check your work using 
cut-and-paste into web forms, open files with web 
browsers, and create Zip files of your work. On Canvas
you are expected to be able to take quizzes, 
post to discussions, submit assignments, find course information, and use the 
Canvas messaging system, calendar, and gradebook, and similar skills.
</p><p>
If you do not feel comfortable with these basic skills, consult with an OC advisor for appropriate courses to take first.
</p><p>
It is expected that you have regular access to a Windows PC with Firefox and Notepad++
installed, or administrator privileges or your own thumb drive so that you can install them. 
</p>
<p>It is expected that the student will have regular Internet access for 
completing and submitting coursework.
<span class="important">
Please develop a plan "B" in case you have issues with your normal Internet 
access and related software that might affect your ability to participate in this class.
</span>
Computer labs are available at all OC campuses. See <a href="http://www.olympic.edu/services/computer-labs" target="_new">Computer Labs</a> 
on the OC website for their locations and hours. All PC labs have Firefox on the machines, but they may not have Notepad++.

<ol>
<li><p id="help"><b>Ask for help</b>:  
  <p><em>First</em>, if you need help, get help early and often - if you wait it can become too
  late. The tutors and I are all available to help you.</p>

<p>If you need assistance or are having problems in this class, please visit with me in person or online
during my office hour so we can discuss your options. 
I am available outside of my office hours as well, by arrangement.
The best way to contact me electronically is to use 
your Canvas Inbox. Canvas' Inbox is where I expect to locate student 
questions. All other methods will take longer and will not keep a centralized location for all our correspondence 
to assist with documentation. I monitor Canvas throughout the weekday during the quarter except on holidays.
</p><p>If you do contact me through Canvas for help - please give sufficient detail, for example,
by pasting the source code in question into the
body of the message and explaining what is happening. The subject needs to identify the topic or lab it is for;
references to past labs will not get prioritized so be sure to use the correct subject line. 
Stacking multiple messages to me with the same subject line may cause earlier ones to be disregarded, as Canvas displays the most recent one first.
</p><p>
I recommend that you do not use Canvas comments on your submissions except at the time you submit;
Canvas does not send notifications of comment updates, so they will not be seen as quickly
as Canvas Inbox messages.
</p><p>You can expect a response from me to your Canvas Inbox message within one business day; do not expect a reply on weekends, breaks, or holidays.</p>
<p>
If we need to use email, I will use your Olympic College email account. Email from non-olympic.edu addresses will be ignored per OC policies.
More information on OC email student accounts can be found at: 
<a href="http://www.olympic.edu/Students/StudentEmail" target="_new">http://www.olympic.edu/Students/StudentEmail</a>. Please ask for help
in a CIS lab if you have not been able to access your OC email account.
</p><p>If for some reason you have to use email (Canvas is preferred), 
    the subject line of your email must include the class, your name, and the topic, like so: <code>CIS 114 | Jane Jones | Lab 1 Firefox crashing</code>. 
    Email messages with that subject line format will be responded to within one business day during the term. Other subject lines may not be noticed
    until I am catching up on older emails.</p></li>
<p>For help with coursework, you may also attend or call in during the 
<a href="http://faculty.olympic.edu/agarripoli/programmingtutors.html" target="_new">CIS Programming Tutor Sessions</a>.
Please only contact the tutors during their open lab time. They are students too, and need time for their own studies when not tutoring.
For Fall 2015, programming tutoring is being held in TEC-212.</p>
<p>The roll of the tutors is to assist the student during tutor sessions in general approaches to problem 
solving, internalizing core concepts, and understanding constructs of a particular 
language. Tutors may review homework only to determine which topics 
require additional attention or review by the student so that they can 
be successful. Tutors are not allowed to directly provide any part of a solution to a 
home work assignment. The work must be the student's own. Tutors are required to report 
students that request help outside of tutoring hours or that request help directly 
completing a home work exercise to the instructor for the class they are seeking help with.</p>

<p>If you need help outside of class material, there are a wide variety of resources available to you.
See <a href="http://www.olympic.edu/services" target="_new">Student Services</a> for assistance.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="etiquette"><b>Etiquette</b>:  
It is expected that students will show common courtesy, be tolerant of others' views, be respectful in dealing with others, 
and use standard English in their communications, both written and verbal. 
<p>This policy defines the behavior expected of all who participate in this class, on ground and on line.  
Disruptive behavior will not be tolerated in the classroom or online; see 
<a href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/WAC/default.aspx?cite=132C-120-076" target="_new">WAC 132C-120-076</a>. 
<span class="important">Students who violate proper Etiquette may be administratively dropped from the course.</span>
<p>Here are our Etiquette guidelines for the class (adapted from the 
<a href="http://jolt.merlot.org/vol6no1/mintu-wimsatt_0310.htm" target="_new">MERLOT Journal of Online Learning and Teaching</a> (under a Creative Commons Attribution-Non-Commercial-Share-Alike License)
):
</p><ul>
<li>Do show common courtesy in your communication.</li>
<li>Do not dominate any discussion.</li>
<li>Do not use offensive language.</li>
<li>Never make fun of someone's ability to read or write.</li>
<li>Use simple English.</li>
<li>When writing, use correct spelling, capitalization, punctuation, and grammar. Remember, capitalization and exclamation points are considered "yelling" electronically.</li>
<li>Share tips with other students. Build a learning community by aiding each others' understanding of the material.</li>
<li>Keep an open mind and be willing to express even your minority opinion.</li>
<li>Be aware of OC's Academic Honesty Policy.</li>
<li>Think, and edit, before you speak or push the "Send" button.</li>
<li>Do not hesitate to ask for feedback.</li>
<li>When in doubt, always check with your instructor for clarification.</li>
</ul>
<p>For ground classes, please refrain from the following during lecture: talking over other people, 
using the computer during discussions (except for note-taking on the discussion), 
cell phones/pagers, gadgets, guests, eating, sleeping, or other disturbances to the class unless an alternative class mode 
of conduct is in effect. Your cooperation is appreciated. </p><p>
"Faculty have the authority to take appropriate action to maintain order and proper 
conduct in the classroom and to maintain the effective cooperation of the class in fulfilling the objectives of the course." (<a href="#wac">WAC</a>)
</p>
</li>
<li><p id="wac"><b>WAC</b>:  
Please review Olympic College's 
<a href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/wac/default.aspx?cite=132C-120" target="_new">WAC 132C</a>
policies. The various WACs have been passed by the state of Washington and are Washington State law that govern the behavior of the administration, faculty, and students.
 </p></li>
 <li><p id="identification"><b>Identification</b>: 
All assignments must have your student name, assignment name, course and date clearly labeled. 
Please see the Web site for the name of the assignment. Failure to follow this policy may result in the deduction of points on the assignment. 
</p></li>
<li><p id="preparation"><b>Preparation</b>:
Students are expected to have read the <a href="#TextRequired">Course Textbook and Additional Material</a> and 
satisfy the <a href="#Expectations">Technical Expectations</a> on or before the start of class. 
Any requested reading or activity should be completed
before the class day of the course, so that the student can better participate in discussions and use
lab time effectively.
Not having a text and not being prepared will not be an acceptable excuse for not being able to participate in class 
or to turn in assignments on time unless there is a textbook acquisition issue with the OC bookstore
(<a href="http://ocbookstore.com/" target="_new">OC Bookstore Web site</a>).
If there are no books on the shelf, please consult a staff member. Do not assume the bookstore is out of textbooks.
</p></li>
<li><p id="assignments"><b>Assignments</b>:  
By taking this class, you are stating that you will be making appropriate time in your schedule 
to ensure success and have access to the resources required for this class. 
<b>Expect to spend about 10-30 hours on this course to ensure success.</b> 
The assigned reading should take 5-10 hours, the class meets for 8 hours, and the assigned projects should take 5-10 hours.
If you review the reading several times, or need greater assistance from the tutors or instructor, expect to spend additional time.   
</p><p>I understand that for many community college students, attending college is a part of a very busy life. 
I know many of you work and have families. When I was a graduate student, I worked full-time. 
As an undergraduate, I worked 20+ hours a week. 
I am a single mother with two teenagers. I know things can get busy. Planning is key.
</p><p>Remember: You are responsible for your learning. 
You may be administratively withdrawn from class if you do not demonstrate participation 
within the first two weeks of the term or for more than three consecutive weeks.
Participation is measured by access to the course shell on Canvas. 
You needs to invest regular, consistent time to succeed in this class.
<P>Time management is your friend or your foe! Waiting until the evening of the due date to ask a 
question of an assignment will not provide success in this class. You may not get 
a response before the due date. That is your responsibility, you alone are responsible for your late start.
Start assignments early and be proactive.
<span class="important">No assignment will be accepted for grading after the last lecture day of the term.</span>
 </p></li><li><p id="duedates"><b>Due dates</b>:  
Assignments are due on time, the date for each is given on the course Canvas site. 
Online postings are due by 11:59 p.m. of the due date or they will be late. 
You can post assignments any time during the current module. 
Please do not wait until the last minute to post your work -- expect connectivity issues with Internet access and plan accordingly.
<span class="important">
All assignments must be posted by 11:59pm of the due date listed for a given item using the appropriate posting for a given assignment to be considered as on-time.
Any assignment not submitted by that time will be considered late.
</span> See <a href="#latework">Late Work</a>.
Do not wait until the last minute to complete your assignments; that will not be excused. 
Note: Emailed assignments will not be accepted for grading unless specified as part of an assignment or previously approved.
 </p></li>
 <li><p id="confirm"><b>Submitting Work</b>:  
When assignments are posted at the Web site, using the form provided, 
Canvas will tell you if it succeeded or failed. I strongly recommend 
returning to the page in another browser window to verify that the 
Discussion Post or File Submission was successfully completed. Since little or no 
paper is used in the class, your only documentation that you posted an assignment 
*is* the successful completion of a submission on Canvas. Please save your files 
and make screenshots of the successful submission. Keep them safe in the event 
of a system failure and/or loss of postings at the class Web site. To date, loss 
of data is extremely rare but can happen since we are using the Internet for 
transmitting data and software to save it at the far end. It is strongly recommend 
that you print out all your form 
confirmations and place them into a confirmation notebook as your backup. 
If issues do arise, one of the first things I may ask to see is your submission 
confirmation. <span class="important">Without a submission confirmation for an assignment, 
you may receive 0 points for an assignment.</span>
</p>
<p>All requirements must be met for your submission to be accepted for grading. Follow
the directions provided in the assignment box to ensure all naming conventions, files requested, 
information requested, and formats requested are provided. Rubrics are also provided so you can further check
your work prior to submitting it.</p></li>
<li><p id="latework"><b>Late work</b>:  
Late assignments are accepted for grading up to 7 days late, only up to the last 
lecture day of the term, with a deduction of up to 5% of 
the points of the assignment per day. This means that
one minute to 24 hours late would be -5%, 24 hours and one minute to 48 hours 
late would be -10%, and so on up to six days and one minute to seven days late at -35%. 
This deduction is applied before the work is graded. </p>
<p>If a late assignment is 
accepted for grading, it will be at the discretion of the 
instructor as to when the assignment will be graded. 
</p>
<p>If submitted over 7 days after the due date, or after the last lecture day of the term,
late work will not be graded; the 
submission will be given 0 points. If you want to have your ungraded late work reviewed, 
you will need to bring it to my office hours for an in-person review. 
</p>
<p>If you have a <span class="important">one time event</span> that is a serious illness or accident, or active duty 
for you, your parent, your spouse, or your child, the late points may be waived.
You must make your request through Canvas at least one full day before the assignment 
is due for a late point waiver or have verifiable proof of your inability to make the request by that time. 
Verification will be required and must be attached to your request. 
Vacations, colds, or other discretionary activities will not be accepted. 
On-going or pre-existing situations can not be used for reasons for late work since 
they were known constraints at the start of the class. 
</p><p>A late assignment is a one time event, and any excused late points will not transfer to additional assignments.
You will need to catch up with the course schedule and continue on time.
If for some reason you cannot catch up, you can contact Registration &amp; Records to withdraw; it is not
sufficient to tell me that you are withdrawing.
</p></li>
<li><p id="withdraw"><b>Withdrawing</b>: 
If you wish to withdraw from this course, please file
the appropriate paperwork with the Office of Registration and Records and then inform me of your decision.
If you are still in the gradebook at the end of the term,
your computed grade with 0's for unsubmitted work will be used unless you have been in
contact with me previously to make other arrangements. 
It is your responsibility to contact Registration and Records,
otherwise you remain enrolled in the course.
</p></li>
<li><p id="redo"><b>Redo work</b>:  
Occasionally I will request that an assignment be redone in whole or in part because it appears that 
the learning outcomes may not have been met regarding that assignment. 
If a redo is requested, a notice will posted in the Comments section of the 
assignment along with the current grade.
You need to resend the requested redo assignment within 3 days of the request,
or one week from the original due date, whichever is later. However, redo work 
will not be accepted after the last lecture day of the term. If not submitted in
a timely fashion, the redo will not be graded and the original grade in Canvas will stand. 
Please contact me via Canvas or during my office hours for instructions and support.

<li><p id="honesty"><b>Academic honesty</b>:  
No academic dishonesty will be tolerated, see 
<a href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/WAC/default.aspx?cite=132C-120-065" target="_new">WAC 132C-120-065</a>. 
Academic dishonesty includes cheating, plagiarism, fabrication, and facilitating academic dishonesty.
Facilitating academic dishonesty includes providing your own work to someone else for their solution; 
do not put the tutors or your classmates in this situation, they cannot provide you with solutions, 
only guidance and explanations.
Evidence of academic dishonesty will result in a forfeiture of points for an assignment.
Continued violations may result in a student being administratively withdrawn from this class.</p>
<p>Unless otherwise noted your assignments are individual assignments and I expect that
your work will be your own. At any point during the quarter, you should be able to
explain or duplicate any of your solutions for your assignments. I
reserve the right to refuse to accept any assignment if you cannot demonstrate the
ability to perform similar work when asked, or if you cannot explain your answer or
approach that you have used. I encourage you to work with one another to
internalize and discuss general concepts and approaches, but your work must be your
own. This includes work with the tutors -- you cannot ask them to provide you with correct syntax
and exact solutions, they can only guide you. You need to develop and internalize the solution yourself.</p>
<p>Please note: cut and paste of another's words is plagiarism. Quoting in a limited amount with a citation noted on the quote is permissible. 
Your words must be your own.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="attendance"><b>Attendance</b>:
Attendance and success in this class have a strong correlation. For on-line students, attendance means keeping up with the
course recordings and readings; be prepared before watching the recording, and plan to watch it within a day of its availability. New concepts tend to
build on previous concepts rather than stand on their own. If you have to miss or delay viewing a class
I suggest you view the available recording and network with other students to gather notes as soon as possible (days, not weeks). 
Utilize my office hours and the tutors to ask for assistance. I am happy to make appointments outside of my
listed hours.</p>
</p></li>
<li><p id="military"><b>Service members</b>: 
I will try to work with service members (military, police, fire, and alike) as best 
possible to enable you to complete this class. You must notify me through Canvas before any 
special accommodations will be made that explains your special situation that 
may temporarily impact your ability to participate in this class. Please note 
that all assignments are open from the start of the quarter. If you know of an 
upcoming situation, please take advantage of this opportunity before requesting accommodations.
</p></li>
<li><p id="requests"><b>Special requests</b>:  
<span class="important">All special requests must be requested through Canvas</span> to develop 
an electronic trail even if we have a face-to-face conversation. After such a conversation, 
send me a message on Canvas or your OC email right away to document what was discussed
and to create an electronic trail of the conversation. It is your responsibility to send that
follow-up message through Canvas or OC email.

Note that about 10% of all OC students have some type of disability, both observable (like the use of a cane) as well as invisible (like 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posttraumatic_stress_disorder" target="_new">PTSD</a>
or 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asperger_syndrome" target="_new">asperger syndrome</a>). 
Most disabilities at OC are invisible.
As an instructor, I cannot disclose a student's disability. 
The decision to share with others is a choice of the student.

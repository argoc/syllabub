  <p>Your grade for the class will be assigned by converting your total of points to a
  percentage grade: Your total points will be multiplied by .20 to compute the percentage
  grade(see scale below).<br>
  <br>
  Example: Say Student Sally Sue earned a total of 450 points.<br>
  <br>
  450 * .20 = 90<br>
  <br>
  So Sally Sue would receive a grade of 3.3. Note however that the 3.3 (or any other
  percent grade) could be rounded down to a 3.2 or up to a 3.4 depending on how close the
  percentage grade falls to the upper or lower bounds. In addition, this rounding may
  take into account other factors such as Sally's attitude and participation.<br>
  <br>
  Note:&nbsp; If your class has an attached CIS 200 LAB your grade on your programming
  projects (LABS/EXERCISES) will be used alone to compute your grade in the CIS 200
  LAB</p>

  <p><strong>GRADING NOTE:</strong></p>

  <p>In order to receive a passing grade, students must spend considerable time outside
  the classroom working on projects, completing reading assignments, and performing
  additional research. Any student not able to make the commitment in time needed to be
  successful should consider auditing the class.</p>

  <div>
    <hr>
  </div>

  <p><strong>ACADEMIC HONESTY:</strong></p>

  <p>Plagiarism and cheating are serious offenses and may be punished by failure on exam,
  paper or project; failure in course; and or expulsion from the College. For more
  information refer to the Student Code of Conduct (<a href=
  "http://www.olympic.edu/StaffFaculty/Policies/ConductCode/violations.htm">http://www.olympic.edu/StaffFaculty/Policies/ConductCode/violations.htm</a>).</p>

  <p>Unless otherwise noted your assignments are individual assignments and I expect that
  you will work on your own.&nbsp; At any point during the quarter, you should be able to
  explain or duplicate any of your solutions/answers &nbsp;for your assignments.&nbsp; I
  reserve the right to refuse to accept any assignment if you cannot demonstrate the
  ability to perform similar work when asked, or if you cannot explain your answer or
  approach that you have used.&nbsp; I encourage you to work with one another to
  internalize and discuss general concepts and approaches, but your work must be your
  own.</p>

  <div>
    <hr>
  </div>

  <p><strong>ATTENDANCE:</strong></p>

  <p>Attendance and success in this class have a strong correlation. New concepts tend to
  build on previous concepts rather than stand on their own. If you have to miss a class
  I suggest you network with other students to gather notes. I often hear the question,
  "I missed yesterday, did you cover anything important." My answer is always the same,
  "Yes." Utilize my office hours to ask for assistance.</p>

  <p>It is expected that students will be tolerant of others' views, be respectful in
  dealing with others, and use standard English in their communications, both written and
  verbal. Disruptive behavior will not be tolerated. Please review Olympic College's
  <a href="http://app.leg.wa.gov/wac/default.aspx?cite=132C-120">WAC 132C-120</a>
  policies. The various WACs have been passed by the state of Washington and are
  Washington State law that govern the behavior of the administration, faculty, and
  students.</p>

  <div>
    <hr>
  </div>

  <p><strong>POLICIES:</strong></p>

  <p>Work turned in late will be given a 25% deduction from the grade otherwise received.
  <span style="color: #ff0000;">Work over one week late will not be accepted for
  grading.</span> No work is accepted after the last regular class meeting for the
  quarter.</p>

  <p>Make-up exams are available only upon arrangement <strong>prior</strong> to the exam
  date.</p>

  <p>If you wish to withdraw from this course, please inform me of your decision and file
  the appropriate paperwork with the Office of Registration and Records. If I have no
  data/grades to work with, an &ldquo;F&rdquo;will be given unless you have been in
  contact with me previously to make arrangements for an<br>
  Incomplete; my understanding is that this has an impact upon Veteran funding.</p>

  <p><strong>HOW TO GET HELP:</strong></p>

  <p>FIRST, if you need help get help early and often - if you wait it can become too
  late<br>
  <br>
  Here are some resources to get help in this class:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Call or stop by during my office hours - hours and number stated above</li>

            <p>Each module has either a lab or a peer review, and a discussion. See the Canvas course shell for additional details. </p>
            <p>Each lab gives you hands-on practice with ASP.NET. In each lab, you develop and test with ASP.NET to gain hands-on experience integrating the course material with your overall ASP.NET knowledge. You will submit a lab package including documentation with screen shots and the files you created or generated. Labs are individual, not group, work. All labs include a debrief section for your reflection and feedback on the lab activities. Lab rubrics are available in the Canvas shell.</p>
            <p>You will also develop your skills in reviewing your peers' work, with several opportunities to review and provide feedback on your peers' projects also.</p>
            <p>Discussions (in class for the ground section, on Canvas for the online section) provide you with the opportunity to discuss relevant ASP.NET topics. Please see the requirements for the online discussions in the Canvas shell; ground discussions will follow a similar format, but be held live, in class. Discussion Rubrics are available in the Canvas shell.</p>

Grading
</h3>
            <p> There are 1110 possible points in this class. A minimum of 700 points are required for a grade. Without prior arrangement, I will record a grade of '0.0' if your points are below 700 points. If a student fails the course or is given a NC, WP or WF, the instructor must report a last attended date. This date can have implications for some sources of funding. In this course the date the student last submitted lab work accepted for grading will be used as the last attended date.</p>

Technical Expectations
</h3>
            <p> This course builds on several skills from prior courses; be sure to review the course prerequisites. In addition, this course uses computers and the language of computers. You are expected to be comfortable using a computer, particularly the Windows operating system; a web browser; e-mail; and the Canvas Learning Management System. You will be expected to use the Visual Studio IDE, create text documents in text editors, check your work using editor plug-ins, or cut-and-paste into web forms, create and edit Word documents, open files with web browsers, take and save screen shots, and create Zip files of your work. On Canvas you are expected to be able to take quizzes, post to discussions, submit assignments, find course information, view recordings, and use the Canvas messaging system, calendar, and gradebook, and similar skills. </p>
            <p> If you do not feel comfortable with these skills, consult with an OC advisor for appropriate courses to take first. </p>
            <p> It is expected that you have regular access to a Windows PC with Firefox, Portable Git, Visual Studio 2015 Update 3, and Microsoft Word 2007 or newer installed, or administrator privileges so that you can install them. If you do not, this software has been installed in TEC-212, TEC-213, TEC-205 and on certain machines in the ST computer lab; and you can access Microsoft Word 2010 via <a href="http://workspace.olympic.edu">workspace.olympic.edu</a>. </p>
            <p>You will need to have regular Internet access for completing and submitting coursework. <strong>
Please develop a plan "B" in case you have issues with your normal Internet 
access and related software that might affect your ability to participate in this class.
Computer or software issue will not change your due date.
</strong> Computer labs are available at all OC campuses. See <a href="http://www.olympic.edu/services/computer-labs" target="_new">Computer Labs</a> on the OC website for their locations and hours. All PC labs have Firefox and Microsoft Word on the machines, but only specific machines have Visual Studio 2015. </p>

                <li id="help"><b>Ask for help</b>:
                    <p><em>First</em>, if you need help, get help early and often - if you wait it can become too late. The instructor and tutors are all available to help you.</p>
                    <p>If you need assistance or are having problems in this class, please visit me in person or online so we can discuss your options. I am available outside of office hours, by arrangement. The best way to contact me electronically is to use your Canvas Inbox. Canvas' Inbox is where I expect to locate student questions. All other methods may take longer and will not keep a centralized location for our correspondence. I monitor Canvas throughout the week during the term, 9am-7pm, less on evenings, weekends and holidays. </p>
                    <p>If you contact me through Canvas for help, please give sufficient detail. For example, attach the source code file in question to the message and explain what is happening. The subject of your message needs to identify the topic or lab it is for; references to past labs will not get prioritized so be sure to use the correct subject line. Stacking multiple messages to us with the same subject line may cause earlier ones to be disregarded, as Canvas displays the most recent one first. </p>
                    <p>You can expect a response from me to your Canvas Inbox message within one school day; do not expect a reply on evenings, weekends, breaks, or holidays.</p>
                    <p> If we need to use email, you must use your Olympic College email account. Email from non-olympic.edu addresses will be ignored per OC policies. More information on OC student accounts can be found at: <a href="http://www.olympic.edu/services/computer-labs/accounts" target="_new">http://www.olympic.edu/Students/StudentEmail</a>. Please ask for help in a CIS lab if you have not been able to access your OC email account or Canvas. </p>
                    <p>If for some reason you have to use email (Canvas is preferred), the subject line of your email must include the class, your name, and the topic, like so: <code>CIS 219 | Jane Jones | Lab 2 Visual Studio won't start</code>. Email messages with that subject line format will be responded to within one business day during the term. Other subject lines may not be noticed until I am catching up on older emails.</p>
                    <p>For help with coursework, you may also attend or call in during the <a href="http://faculty.olympic.edu/agarripoli/programmingtutors.html" target="_new">CIS Programming Tutor Sessions</a>. Please only contact the tutors during their open lab time. They are students too, and need time for their own studies when not tutoring. For Fall 2016, programming tutoring is being held in TEC-212.</p>
                    <p>The role of the tutors is to assist the student during tutor sessions in general approaches to problem solving, internalizing core concepts, and understanding constructs of a particular language. Tutors may review homework only to determine which topics require additional attention or review by the student so that they can be successful. <strong>Tutors and other students are not allowed to directly provide 
any part of a solution to a home work assignment.</strong> The work must be the student's own. Tutors are required to report students that request help outside of tutoring hours or that request help directly completing a home work exercise to the instructor for the course they are seeking help with.</p>
                    <p>If you need help outside of class material, there are a wide variety of resources available to you. See <a href="http://www.olympic.edu/services" target="_new">Student Services</a> and also <a href="http://www.olympic.edu/current-students/advising/counseling-services" target="_new">Counseling Services</a> for assistance.</p>
                </li>
                <li id="etiquette"><b>Etiquette/Netiquette</b>: This policy defines the behavior expected of all who participate in this class, on ground and on line. It is expected that instructors and students will be tolerant of othersâ€™ views, be respectful in dealing with others, show common courtesy, and use standard professional English in their communications, both written and verbal. Remember that capitalization and exclamation points are considered yelling, and texting lingo is not professional. Ask first if you are not sure if your note is offensive, and respect the opinions of others. You are expected to behave in a professional manner, and will be held to a standard of professional etiquette.
                    <p>Violations of this policy may result in lowering of an assignment grade or your overall course grade, reporting the violation to student services, or administrative withdrawal from the class. Disruptive behavior will not be tolerated in the classroom or online; see <a href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/WAC/default.aspx?cite=132C-120-076" target="_new">WAC 132C-120-076</a>.
                        <p>Be respectful of others' opinions. Disagreement is fine but do so in a straightforward and polite way. There is nothing to be gained from making rude, insulting or abusive remarks verbally or electronically.</p>
                        <p>For ground classes, refrain from the following during discussion: talking over other people, using the computer (except for note-taking on the discussion), cell phones/pagers, gadgets, guests, eating, sleeping, or other disturbances to the class unless an alternative class mode of conduct is in effect. </p>
                </li>
                <li id="honesty"><b>Academic honesty</b>: No academic dishonesty will be tolerated, see <a href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/WAC/default.aspx?cite=132C-120-065" target="_new">WAC 132C-120-065</a>. Academic dishonesty includes cheating, plagiarism, fabrication, and facilitating academic dishonesty. Facilitating <strong>academic dishonesty includes providing your own work to someone else for their solution</strong>; do not put the tutors or your classmates in this situation, they cannot provide you with solutions or partial solutions, only guidance and explanations.</p>
                    <p>Evidence of academic dishonesty will result in a forfeiture of points for an assignment and will be reported to student services. Continued violations may result in a 0.0 course grade or being administratively withdrawn from the course.</p>
                    <p>Unless otherwise noted your assignments are individual assignments and I expect that your work will be your own. At any point during the term, you should be able to explain or duplicate any of your solutions for your assignments. I reserve the right to refuse to accept any assignment if you cannot demonstrate the ability to perform similar work when asked, or if you cannot explain your answer or approach that you have used. I encourage you to talk with one another to internalize and discuss general concepts and approaches, but your work must be your own. This includes work with the tutors -- you cannot ask them to provide you with correct syntax and exact solutions, they can only guide you. You need to develop and internalize the solution yourself.</p>
                    <p>Please note: cut and paste of another's words is plagiarism. Quoting in a limited amount with a citation noted on the quote is permissible. Your words must be your own.</p>
                </li>
                <li id="identification"><b>Identification</b>: All assignments must have your student name, assignment name, course and date clearly labeled. Be sure to follow all requested formats in labs and posts. Please see the Web site for the name of the assignment. Failure to follow this policy may result in the deduction of points on the assignment. </li>
                <li id="preparation"><b>Preparation</b>: Students are expected to have the <a href="#TextRequired">Course Textbook</a> and satisfy the <a href="#Technology">Technical Expectations</a> on or before the start of class. Any requested reading or activity should be completed before the first class day of the module, so that the student can better participate in discussions and use lab time effectively. Not having a text and not being prepared will not be an acceptable excuse for not being able to participate in class or to turn in assignments on time
                    <!-- unless there is a textbook acquisition issue with the OC bookstore
(<a href="http://ocbookstore.com/" target="_new">OC Bookstore Web site</a>) .
If there are no books on the shelf, please consult a staff member. 
Do not assume the bookstore is out of textbooks-->. </p>
                </li>
                <li id="assignments"><b>Assignments</b>: By taking this course, you are stating that you will be making appropriate time in your schedule to ensure success and have access to the resources required for this class. <strong>Expect to spend about 3 hours per week for each class credit to ensure success.</strong> This is a 4 credit class. 4 credit class = 12 hours of class work per week. If you review class recordings several times, expect to spend additional time. Being a full-time student is a full-time job, with 15 credits easily 40+ hours per week for class and study time. </p>
                    <p>I know things can get busy. Planning is key. Remember: You are responsible for your learning. You need to invest regular, consistent time to succeed in this course. </p>
                    <p>Learning takes doing, not just listening to lectures or reading the text. The Labs, Discussions, and Quizzes are key experiences to ensure you have learned the material and internalized the course outcomes. </p>
                    <p>You may be administratively withdrawn from the course if you do not complete the syllabus quiz within the first week of the term. </p>
                    <p>Time management is your friend or your foe! Remember, the due date is not the "do" date. Waiting until the evening of the due date to ask a question of an assignment will not provide success in this course. You may not get a response before the due date. That is your responsibility, you alone are responsible for your late start. Start assignments early and be proactive. <strong>No late assignment will be accepted for grading after the last lecture day of the term.</strong> </p>
                </li>
                <li id="duedates"><b>Due dates</b>: Assignments are due on time, the date for each is given on the course Canvas site. Online postings are due by 11:59:00 p.m. of the due date or they will be late. You can post assignments prior to their due date; grading is done once the due date is past. <strong>Do not wait until the last minute to post your work</strong> -- expect connectivity issues with Internet access and plan accordingly. <strong>
All assignments must be posted by 11:59:00pm of the due date listed for a 
given item using the appropriate posting for a given assignment to be considered as on-time.
Any assignment not submitted by that time will be considered late.
</strong>
                    <p>If you want to have ungraded late work reviewed, you will need to bring it to my office hours for an in-person or in-Skype review. It will not be graded, but feedback on your work will be provided. </p> Do not wait until the last minute to complete your assignments; that will not be excused. Note: work submitted in email or the Canvas Inbox will not be accepted for grading unless specified as part of an assignment or previously approved. </p>
    </li>
    <li id="confirm"><b>Submitting Work</b>: When assignments are posted in the appropriate dro box on the Canvas site, Canvas will tell you if it succeeded or failed. I strongly recommend returning to the course page in another browser window to verify that the Discussion Post or File Submission was successfully completed, and put in the correct course and assignment. Since little or no paper is used in the course, your only documentation that you posted an assignment is the successful completion of a submission on Canvas. Please save your files and make screenshots of the successful submission. Keep them safe in the event of a system failure and/or loss of postings at the course Web site. To date, loss of data is extremely rare but can happen since we are using the Internet for transmitting data and software to save it at the far end. It is strongly recommend that you print out all your form confirmations and place them into a confirmation notebook as your backup. If issues do arise, one of the first things I may ask to see is your submission confirmation. <strong>Without a submission confirmation for an assignment, in
the correct course assignment, you may receive 0 points for an assignment.</strong> </p>
        <p>All requirements must be met for your submission to be accepted for grading. Follow the directions provided in the assignment box to ensure all naming conventions, files requested, information requested, and formats requested are provided. </p>
    </li>
    <li id="latework"><b>Late work</b>: For this course, you are given 3 "Late Tickets" for your use. A late ticket lets you turn in a specific lab or complete a specific quiz up to 5 calendar days late with no penalty. You must request a late ticket by the due date of the assignment if you plan to use a late ticket for the assignment, using the Late Ticket drop box. When you have used all of your late tickets, no more late work will be accepted.
        <!-- 
<strong>Late Tickets can not be used for Discussions since they are time sensitive. </strong>-->I recommend that you hold on to your Late Tickets as long as possible for real emergencies, as additional late tickets will not be provided. The last day to post late work is the last date of regular classes, December 2, 2016. This class has 3 late tickets, use them wisely! </p>
        <p>Late tickets do not apply to the discussions, including peer reviews; that work needs to be completed by the due date as it is a "live" online conversation. Work completed in each module will be graded at that time.</p>
        <p>If a late assignment is accepted for grading, it will be graded at the discretion of the instructor both for points as well as to when the assignment will be graded. </p>
        <p>If you have a <strong>one time event</strong> that is a serious illness or accident, or active duty for you, your parent, your spouse, your child, or your legal ward, the late policy may be waived. You must make your request through Canvas at least one full day before the assignment is due for a late policy waiver or have verifiable proof of your inability to make the request by that time. </p>
        <p> Vacations, colds, or other discretionary activities will not be accepted. On-going or pre-existing situations can not be used for reasons for late work as they were known constraints at the start of the course. </p>
        <p>A late waiver is a one-time, one-assignment event, and any excused late work will not transfer to additional assignments. You will need to catch up with the course schedule and continue on time. If for some reason you cannot catch up, you can contact Registration &amp; Records to withdraw; it is not sufficient to tell me that you are withdrawing. </p>
    </li>
    <li id="withdraw"><b>Withdrawing</b>: If you wish to withdraw from this course, please file the appropriate paperwork with the Office of Registration and Records and then inform me of your decision. If you are still in the gradebook at the end of the term, your computed grade with 0's for unsubmitted work will be used unless you have been in contact with me previously to make other arrangements. It is your responsibility to contact Registration and Records, otherwise you remain enrolled in the course. </li>
    <li id="redo"><b>Redo work</b>: Occasionally I will request that an assignment be redone in whole or in part because it appears that the learning outcomes may not have been met regarding that assignment. Redo assignments are a courtesy, not a right. If a redo is requested, a notice will posted in the Grades section in the comments area of your submission, along with the current grade. You need to resend the requested redo assignment within 3 days of the request, or one week from the original due date, whichever is later. However, redo work will not be accepted after the last lecture day of the term. If not submitted in a timely fashion, the redo will not be graded and the original grade in Canvas will stand. If a redone assignment is accepted for grading, it will be graded at the discretion of the instructor both for points as well as to when the assignment will be graded. Please contact me via Canvas or during my office hours for instructions and support. </li>
    <li id="attendance"><b>Attendance</b>: Attendance and success in this course have a strong correlation. Attendance means attending live or keeping up with the course videos and readings; be prepared before coming to class or watching a recording, and keep up with videos during their module. New concepts tend to build on previous concepts rather than stand on their own. If you have to miss class or delay viewing a video I suggest you network with other students to gather notes as soon as possible (days, not weeks). Utilize office hours and the tutors to ask for assistance. I am happy to make appointments outside of my listed office hours. </li>
    <li id="recordings"><b>Recordings</b>: All recordings provided for this course through Canvas are &copy; Copyright Olympic College. If you have copied or downloaded any of the recordings, you must delete them once the term completes. Olympic College does not grant permission to retain recordings of class material. All class presentations are recorded; if you do not want your voice or likeness captured, you will need to view the recording rather than be present in the classroom. See the <a href="https://www.olympic.edu/sites/default/files/files/20025CopyrightPolicy.pdf">OC Copyright Policy</a>.
        <li id="military"><b>Service members</b>: I work with service members (military, police, fire, and alike) as best possible to enable you to complete this course. You must notify me through Canvas before any special accommodations will be made that explains your special situation that may temporarily impact your ability to participate in this course. Please note that all assignments are open from the start of the term. If you know of an upcoming situation, please take advantage of this opportunity before requesting accommodations. </li>
        <li id="requests"><b>Special requests</b>: <strong>All special requests must be requested through Canvas</strong> to develop an electronic trail even if we have a face-to-face conversation. After such a conversation, send me a message on Canvas or your OC email right away to document what was discussed and to create an electronic trail of the conversation. It is your responsibility to send that follow-up message through Canvas or OC email. </li>
        <li id="safety"><b>Internet Safety</b>: It is your responsibility to be aware of the impact of your actions when using the internet, with respect to managing your privacy, using the information you access, and maintaining machine security. For more information on this topic, see <a href="http://cis2.oc.ctc.edu/oc_apps/Westlund/OnlineSafety.htm" target="_new">Thinking about Online Safety</a>. </li>
        <li id="wac"><b>WAC Regulations</b>: Please review Olympic College's <a href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/wac/default.aspx?cite=132c" target="_new">WAC 132C</a> regulations. The various WACs have been passed by the state of Washington and are Washington State law that govern the behavior of the administration, faculty, and students. </li> Any failure to comply with these policies may result in lowering of an assignment grade, your course grade, or reporting to Student Services. </ol>

                        <p>See the Canvas Course or your <a href="https://olympic.instructure.com/calendar" target="_new">Canvas Calendar</a> for the current schedule of assignments.</p>
						<p>Each class meeting is about 1.5 hours, and is organized for active learning. Do the reading prior to class, and bring your questions. We will use part of our class time to have guided coding, where you work on exercises. On Fridays, we will be reviewing the prior week's homework.</p>
						<p>See more detailed rubrics for Homework and Assignments in the course shell. Homework is graded on effort and results, while Assignments are graded on results and style.</p>
						<p>The homework and assignments are expected to take 6-10 hours each week; with assignments, you will compile a lab package to submit with your source code, requested output, and a report on the length of time you took and the issues you ran into. I recommend getting an early start so that you have time to seek help from the tutors and me, or finding outside resources to aid your understanding of the material and finding a solution.</p>
						<p>If you require alternative arrangements for the Midterm or Final Exam, let me know in the first two weeks of the quarter so that an alternative can be arranged. Otherwise, you will be expected to take the exam in the classroom at the assigned time. Exams are closed-book and closed-computer; you will be writing code out on paper. I strongly recommend doing a dry run with the provided sample exams.</p>

                            Grading</h3></header>
							<p>Your grade is computed by a weighted average of your work on Homework, Sections, the Midterm, and the Final as follows:
							<ul>
							<li>Homework 30% (weekly Practice-It! self-checks and exercises)</li>
							<li>Assignments 30% (3 @ 10% each)</li>
							<li>Midterm 20% (in-class)</li>
							<li>Final 20% (take-home and in-class)</li>
							</ul>
                    <p> A minimum of 60% is required for a grade. Without prior arrangement, I will record a grade of '0.0' if your points are below 60%. If a student fails the course or is given a NC, WP or WF, the instructor must report a last attended date. This date can have implications for some sources of funding. In this course the date the student last submitted lab work accepted for grading will be used as the last attended date.</p>
						<p>If you do not complete the first week's activities for the course, you will be administratively withdrawn from the course. Completion of those activities is used to measure initial attendance.</p>
                        <p>Even with sufficient points, you may be administratively withdrawn from class if you do not demonstrate participation for two or more consecutive weeks.</p>

                        <p>This course uses computers and the language of computers. You are expected to be comfortable using a computer, particularly the Windows operating system; a web browser; e-mail; and the Canvas Learning Management System. You will be expected to learn and use the jGrasp IDE, create text documents in text editors, check your work using web tools, open files with web browsers, take and save screen shots, and create Zip files of your work. On Canvas you are expected to be able to take quizzes, post to discussion boards, submit assignments, find course information, view recordings, and use the Canvas messaging system, calendar, and gradebook, and similar skills. </p>
                        <p> If you do not feel comfortable with these skills, consult with an OC advisor for appropriate courses to take first. </p>
                          <p> It is expected that you have regular access to a Windows PC with Firefox, JDK 1.8, and jGrasp installed, or administrator privileges so that you can install them. If you do not, this software has been installed in 8-123(ST-123), 12-226(TEC-201), 12-215(TEC-213), 12-222(TEC-205) and on certain machines in the 8-122(ST-122) computer lab.

                        <p>You will need to schedule sufficient time in the labs that provide jGrasp, or install the software on a PC you have regular access to, to complete the coursework. We use jGrasp and JDK 1.8 to develop and run our code in this class.</p>
                        <p>You will need to have regular Internet access for completing and submitting coursework. <strong>Please develop a plan "B" in case you have issues with your normal Internet access and related software that might affect your ability to participate in this class. Computer or software issues will not change your due date.</strong> Computer labs are available at all OC campuses. See <a href="http://www.olympic.edu/services/computer-labs" target="_new">Computer Labs</a> on the OC website for their locations and hours. All PC labs have Firefox and Microsoft Word on the machines. Only the Bremerton CIS labs (12-226, 12-222, 12-215) and PC lab 8-122 have jGrasp with JDK 1.8 installed.</p>

                                <p><em>First</em>, if you need help, get help early and often - if you wait it can become too late. Start assignments early and be proactive. The tutors and instructor are all available to help you.</p>
                                <p>If you need assistance or are having problems in this class, please visit with me in person or online during office hours so we can discuss your options. I am available outside of office hours as well, by arrangement. The best way to contact me electronically is to use your Canvas Inbox. I monitor Canvas throughout the week during the term, 9am-7pm, less on evenings, weekends and holidays. </p>
                                <p>If you do contact me through Canvas for help - please give a clear subject and sufficient detail, for example, by attaching the source code file in question to the message and explaining what is happening. </p>
                                <p>You can expect a response from me to your Canvas Inbox message within one school day; do not expect a reply on weekends, breaks, or holidays. If you do not get a response in that timeframe, resend your message and check the to: address to ensure it is going to the appropriate person.</p>
                                <p> If we need to use email, you must use your Olympic College email account. Email from non-olympic.edu addresses will be ignored per OC policies. More information on OC email student accounts can be found at: <a href="https://www.olympic.edu/services/computer-labs/accounts" target="_blank">https://www.olympic.edu/services/computer-labs/accounts</a>. Please ask for help in an OC lab if you have not been able to access your OC email account. </p>
                                <p>If for some reason you have to use email (Canvas is preferred), the subject line of your email must include the class, your name, and the topic, like so: <code>CS 141 | Jane Jones | Lab 1 keeps getting NullPointerException</code>. Email messages with that subject line format will be responded to within one school day during the term. Other subject lines may not be noticed until I am catching up on older emails.</p>
                                <p>For help with coursework, there are Java and Programming tutors.
								The Java tutor information will be available at <a href="https://www.olympic.edu/services/tutoring-services">Tutoring Services</a>.
								You may also attend or call in during the <a href="http://cis2.oc.ctc.edu/oc_apps/CIS/da/cisadvisor.php?pg=help" target="_blank">CIS Programming Tutor Sessions</a>. Please only contact the tutors during their open lab time. They are students too, and need time for their own studies when not tutoring. For Fall 2018, programming tutoring is being held in TEC-212.</p>
                                <p>The role of the tutors is to assist the student during tutor sessions in general approaches to problem solving, internalizing core concepts, and understanding constructs of a particular language. Tutors may review homework only to determine which topics require additional attention or review by the student so that they can be successful. <strong>Do not show your work to your classmates.</strong> Tutors and other individuals are not allowed to directly provide any part of a solution to a home work assignment. The work must be the student's own. Tutors are required to report students that request help outside of tutoring hours or that request help directly completing a home work exercise to the instructor for the course they are seeking help with.</p>
                                <p>If you need help outside of class material, there are a wide variety of resources available to you. See <a href="http://www.olympic.edu/services" target="_blank">Student Services</a> and also <a href="https://www.olympic.edu/current-students/counseling-services">Counseling Services</a> for assistance.</p>

                                <p><b>Etiquette/Netiquette</b>: It is expected that both in person and in electronic communication, students and instructors will act in a professional manner. This includes that we all be tolerant of others’ views, be respectful in dealing with others, show common courtesy, and use standard professional English in our communications, both written and verbal. Remember that capitalization and exclamation points are considered yelling, and texting lingo is not professional. Ask first if you are not sure if your note is offensive. </p>
                                <p>Violations of this policy may result in lowering of an assignment grade or your overall course grade, reporting the violation to student services, or administrative withdrawal from the class. <a href="http://app.leg.wa.gov/WAC/default.aspx?cite=132C-120-065">WAC 132C-120-065</a> specifies particular prohibited student conduct including academic dishonesty, plagiarism, cyber misconduct and other prohibited conduct.

                                <p>For ground classes, refrain from the following during class time: talking over other people, using the computer for non-class activities, cell phones/pagers, gadgets, guests, eating, sleeping, or other disturbances to the class unless an alternative class mode of conduct is in effect. </p>

                            <li id="effort"><b>Effort</b>: Regular attendance and success in this course have a strong correlation. Regular attendance for our class means:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>You are logging in to the Canvas classroom at least three times per week. </li>
                                    <li>You are completing the reading and viewing prior to attending class. </li>
                                    <li>You are attending, or when absent, completing the activity during its applicable week/module. </li>
                                    <li>You have a plan B in place in case your internet access is interrupted, and use it. </li>
                                    <li>You make regular progress on the reading and homework each week. </li>
                                    <li>You seek assistance promptly from the instructor or tutors when you have questions on the reading, the recordings, or any assignments. </li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>New concepts tend to build on previous concepts rather than stand on their own. If you have to delay your progress in this course, I suggest you catch up quickly and network with other students to get on track as soon as possible (days, not weeks). Utilize office hours and the tutors to ask for assistance.</p>
                                <p>Students are expected to have the <a href="#TextRequired">Course Textbook</a> and satisfy the <a href="#expectations">Technical Expectations</a> on or before the start of class. Any requested reading or activity should be completed before the first class day of the module, so that the student can better participate in discussions and use lab time effectively. Not having a text and not being prepared will not be an acceptable excuse for not being able to participate in class or to turn in assignments on time unless there is a textbook acquisition issue with the OC bookstore (<a href="http://ocbookstore.com/" target="_blank">OC Bookstore Web site</a>). If there are no books on the shelf, please consult a staff member. Do not assume the bookstore is out of textbooks. </p>
                                <p>By taking this course, you are stating that you will be making appropriate time in your schedule to ensure success and have access to the resources required for this class. <strong>Expect to spend about 3 hours per week for each class credit to ensure success.</strong> For a 5 credit class this is 15 hours of class work per week. If you review class readings several times,  expect to spend additional time. Being a full-time student is a full-time job, with 15 credits there are easily 40+ hours per week in class and study time. </p>
                                <p>I understand that for many community college students, attending college is a part of a very busy life. I know things can get busy. Planning is key. </p>
                                <p>Remember: You are responsible for your learning. You may be administratively withdrawn from course if you do not demonstrate participation within the first week of the term. Participation in the first week is measured by attendance, access to the Canvas course, and timely completion of the activities. You need to invest regular, consistent time to succeed in this course.</p>
                                <p>Time management is your friend or your foe! Waiting until the evening of the due date to ask a question of an assignment will not provide success in this course. You may not get a response before the due date. That is your responsibility, you alone are responsible for your late start. Start assignments early and be proactive. </p>
                                <p>At the end of the day, you need to make the choices to maximize your learning.</p>

                                <p><b>Due dates</b>: Assignments are due on time, the date for each is given on the course Canvas site. Online postings are due by 11:59:00 p.m. of the due date or they will not be accepted. See the Late Work policy for late submissions. If Canvas marks a submission as late, it is late. You can post assignments prior to their due date, however manual grading is typically done once the due date is past. Please <strong>do not wait until the last minute to post your work</strong> -- expect connectivity issues with Internet access and plan accordingly. Especially if you are uploading large files, you will need to start the upload early, and leave time for your plan B solution if you should lose internet connectivity during the upload.
                                <strong>All assignments must be posted by 11:59:00pm of the due date listed for a given item using the appropriate posting for a given assignment to be considered as on-time. Any assignment not submitted by that time will be considered late.</strong> Do not wait until the last minute to complete or upload your assignments; that will not be excused. Note: Emailed assignments will not be accepted for grading unless specified as part of an assignment or previously approved. </p>
                                <p>When assignments are posted at the Web site, using the form provided, Canvas will tell you if it succeeded or failed. I strongly recommend returning to the course page in another browser window to verify that the File Submission was successfully completed, and put in the correct course and assignment. Since little or no paper is used in the course, your only documentation that you posted an assignment is the successful completion of a submission on Canvas. Please save your files and make screenshots of the successful submission. Keep them safe in the event of a system failure and/or loss of postings at the course Web site. To date, loss of data is extremely rare but can happen since we are using the Internet for transmitting data and software to save it at the far end. It is strongly recommend that you print out all your form confirmations and place them into a confirmation notebook as your backup. If issues do arise, one of the first things I may ask to see is your submission confirmation.
                                <strong>Without a submission confirmation for an assignment, in the correct course assignment, you may receive 0 points for an assignment.</strong> </p>
                                <p>All directions must be followed for your submission to be accepted for grading. Follow the directions provided in the assignment box to ensure all naming conventions, files requested, information requested, and formats requested are provided. </p>
                            <li id="late">
                              <p><b>Late Work</b>: Each assignment will list its due date. Most homework assignments are due on Mondays at 11:59 pm. Each student will have a total of four "free" late days. There are no partial days, so assignments are either on time, 1 day late, 2 days late, etc. No homework will be accepted more than 2 days late. Because of this policy, students will not be granted extensions for assignments unless they have highly extenuating circumstances. Once a student has used up all free late days, each successive late day will result in a loss of 10% of the total possible points on the work. Exams cannot be submitted late. No assignment can be submitted late after 11:59 pm of the last day of class (Friday, November 30th).</p>
  <p>Accepted late work will be graded at the discretion of the instructor both for points as well as to when the assignment will be graded.</p>
  <p>If you have a <strong>one time event</strong> that is a serious illness or accident, or emergency service or active duty for you, your parent, your spouse, or your child, the late policy may be waived. You must make your request through Canvas at least one full day before the assignment is due for a late policy waiver or have verifiable proof of your inability to make the request by that time. Vacations, colds, or other discretionary activities will not be accepted. On-going or pre-existing situations can not be used for reasons for late work as they were known constraints at the start of the course.</p>
  <p>A late waiver is a one-time, one-assignment event, and any excused late work will not transfer to additional assignments. You will need to catch up with the course schedule and continue on time. If for some reason you cannot catch up, you can contact Registration &amp; Records to withdraw; it is not sufficient to tell me that you are withdrawing.</p>
  <p>Accepted late waivers will be graded at the discretion of the instructor both for points as well as to when the assignment will be graded.</p>
  <p>Occasionally I will request that an assignment be redone in whole or in part because it appears that the learning outcomes may not have been met regarding that assignment. If a redo is requested, a notice will posted in the Comments section of the assignment along with the current grade. You need to resend the requested redo assignment within 3 days of the request. However, redo work will not be accepted after the last lecture day of the term. If not submitted in a timely fashion, the redo will not be graded and the original grade in Canvas will stand. Please contact me via Canvas or during our office or lab hours for instructions and support. Please see Redo assignments as a courtesy and not as a right. Redo work will be graded at the discretion of the instructor both for points as well as to when the assignment will be graded.</p>

                                <p><b>Withdrawing</b>: If you wish to withdraw from this course, please file the appropriate paperwork with the Office of Registration and Records and then inform me of your decision. If you are still in the gradebook at the end of the term, your computed grade with 0's for unsubmitted work will be used unless you have been in contact with me previously to make other arrangements or you were administratively withdrawn for non-attendance. It is your responsibility to contact Registration and Records, otherwise you remain enrolled in the course. </p>

                                <p><b>Academic honesty</b>: No academic dishonesty will be tolerated, see <a href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/WAC/default.aspx?cite=132C-120-065" target="_blank">WAC 132C-120-065</a>. Academic dishonesty includes cheating, plagiarism, fabrication, and facilitating academic dishonesty. <strong>Facilitating academic dishonesty includes providing your own work to someone else for their solution</strong>; do not put the tutors or your classmates in this situation, they cannot provide you with solutions, only guidance and explanations.</p>
                                <p>Evidence of academic dishonesty will result in a forfeiture of points for an assignment and will be reported to student services. Continued violations may result in a student being assigned a WF, 0.0, or administratively withdrawn from this course.</p>
                                <p>Unless otherwise noted your assignments are individual assignments and I expect that your work will be your own. At any point during the term, you should be able to explain or duplicate any of your solutions for your assignments. I reserve the right to refuse to accept any assignment if you cannot demonstrate the ability to perform similar work when asked, or if you cannot explain your answer or approach that you have used. I encourage you to talk with one another to internalize and discuss general concepts and approaches, but your work must be your own. You must not show your peers in the class your actual work -- that would permit them to use your work as their own. When you work with the tutors, you cannot ask them to provide you with correct syntax and exact solutions, they can only guide you. You need to develop and internalize the solution yourself.</p>
                                <p>Please note: cut and paste of another's words or code is plagiarism. Quoting in a limited amount with a citation noted on the quote is permissible unless explicitly requested otherwise. Using someone else's code is not permitted, this course is about developing your own coding skills. Your words and code must be your own.</p>
								<p>You are to complete programming assignments individually. You may discuss the assignment in general terms with other students including a discussion of how to approach the problem, but the code you write must be your own. The intent is to allow you to get some help when you are stuck, but this help should be limited and should never involve details of how to code a solution. <strong>You must abide by the following</strong>:
								<ul>
								<li>You may not work as a partner with another student on an assignment.</li>
								<li>You may not show another student your solution to an assignment.</li>
								<li>You may not have another person (current student, former student, tutor, friend, anyone) "walk you through" how to solve an assignment.</li>
								<li>You may not post your homework solution code online to ask others for help or in a public place. This includes public message boards, forums, file sharing sites and services, public web sites, or any other online system.</li>
								<li>You are not to examine online solutions that you might find on the web.</li>
								</ul></p>
								<p>Under our policy, a student who gives inappropriate help is equally guilty as one who receives it. Instead of providing such help, refer other students to class resources (lecture examples, the textbook, the tutors, or the instructor). You must not share your solution and ideas with others. You must also ensure that your work is not copied by others by not leaving it in public places, emailing it to others, posting it on the web, etc. The MESH office has a shred box -- I recommend you use that if you have printed out code.</p>
								<p>We enforce this policy by running similarity-detecting software over submitted student programs, including programs from past quarters and other sources.</p>

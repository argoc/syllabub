Modules may span several weeks, as noted above. Make progress each week to ensure timely completion of your work. If you wait to start the research, you may find it very difficult to complete it on time with sufficient depth and content.</p>
                        <p>Each week you will have the opportunity to develop your research skills; work for each module is spread out during the module. Each module contains a series of activities around a lab and its concepts.</p>
                        <p>The course has a final project; rather than the prior lab activities, in the final weeks you will complete a paper, presentation, and publication, as well as evaluating your peers' deliverables.</p>

                            Grading &amp; Assignments</h3></header>
                        <p> There are 1000 possible points in this course. Refer to Canvas for specific points on each assignment.</p>
                        <p>Even with sufficient points, you may be administratively withdrawn from class if you do not demonstrate participation for two or more consecutive modules.</p>
                        <p>Point Distribution:</p>

                                <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">10 journal entries &mdash; 20 points each for 200 points</span></p>
                                <p>Beginning in module 1 and continuing throughout the course, students will post reflective and ongoing journal entries that document their observations, thoughts, and progress. Journal entries will be shared on your blog and reviewed by the instructor as a means of providing dialogue that will help guide the student through his or her experiences. These are due each Sunday.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">8 research-related lab activitiesâ€”25 points each for 200 points</span></p>
                                <p>Students will participate in discussions and lab activities for the first half of the term, and ongoing discussions of each others' research for the second half of the term. This will include open floor discussions relevant to your research and hands-on research-related activities. We're doing this rather than having online Canvas discussions so that you can participate in a free-flowing discussion not directly measured by word-count; however, you will each need to speak up and contribute. For some of you, this is easy; if you are a talker, encourage the more reticent to participate as actively as you rather than taking over the discussions. These are due at each lab night; the drop box for those with submissions remains open until midnight the next night, but you will be given the opportunity to submit work during the lab. If you cannot attend a lab, please contact Rich at least 24 hours prior to determine an appropriate alternative activity.</p>

                                <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">10 progress reports and mentor sessionsâ€”10 points each for 100 points</span></p>
                                <p>Students will prepare a written progress report and also spend 15-30 minutes each week with the instructor, reviewing their progress, issues they've hit, and their planned outcomes for their research. With a long, free-form goal of a large paper, it is important to make regular, steady progress &mdash; starting the research in the final week will not be sufficient. So, completing regular progress reports and mentor sessions that show the work is on target will be critical to ensuring your success. Prepare each report using the assignment description provided, prior to attending your weekly mentor session. Show up or Skype-in on time for your mentor session. If you need to reschedule a mentor session, recognize that my schedule will be fairly full with the class's mentor sessions so it will be difficult to reschedule. You can reschedule a session to sooner than your normal one, if there is a slot available, without a late penalty being applied; any scheduled for later than your slot will have the penalty applied. Your progress report is due one hour before your mentor session each week (the course shell has then assigned as due on Fridays until the schedule is put in place).</p>

                                <p>At the conclusion of the research, you will be reviewing 2 of your peers' research papers, 2 of your peers' publications, and 2 of the presentations. Submit a peer review for the assigned items on Canvas by filling out the rubric against that item for your peer and giving some concrete feedback based on your rubric scoring for them. Your scoring and feedback need to reflect upon each other, and also on the actual presentation delivered. All assigned reviews must be completed on time, the rubric filled out appropriately and matching, concrete feedback supplied to peer.</p>

                                <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">White Paperâ€”200 points</span></p>
                                <p>Based on research, data, and information gathered, students will prepare a professional white paper to be shared with the class. White paper content will reflect the student's own thinking, be grammatically correct, be fully cited, and follow standard guidelines for formatting â€” see instructions in the Canvas classroom for this assignment. White papers will undergo a peer review process. See the associated rubric for more information. The white paper is due June 5, so that it can be peer-reviewed in the final week. The peer review is due June 9. Your final version of the paper can be resubmitted for instructor grading on June 12. </p>
                                <p>As long as your paper satisfies the research paper rubric for this course, it may use substantial portions of work from your concurrent courses IS 438, Information Security II, and OLRM 320, Leadership in a Digital Economy. You may not submit a previously submitted paper to another course, and all papers will be submitted using Turn It In.</p>

                                <p>Using the same research, data, and information gathering, students will prepare an oral presentation that encapsulates and summarizes their results. Presentations will involve the entire class and additional interested faculty and OC students. All IS students will be in the audience for presenters. Students will provide feedback for their peers. See the associated rubric for more information. Presentations are due June 8 and will be delivered that week; sessions will be scheduled based on your availability, we will use additional evenings if needed (June 13 and ??).</p>

                                <p>Using the same research, data, and information gathering for the report, students will prepare an original infographic or pamphlet. Publications will be peer-reviewed by classmates. See the associated rubric for more information. The publication is due June 12, and the peer review is due by June 16, the final day of finals week.</p>

                        <p>Your grade for the class will be assigned by converting your total points to a percentage grade, by dividing them by 10. So if your total points was 900, your grade would be 90%, which is an A-, GPA 3.7 in our chart. If a student fails the course with a 0.0 or is assigned a NC, WP, or WF, the instructor must report a last attended date. The last attended date used in this course will be the date of the last submitted work accepted for grading. </p>

                        <p>Points on work submitted on-time are posted as soon as possible, usually within 7 days of the due date; a bit more during exams or if my schedule gets impacted. My goal is to give reasonable feedback to as many students as possible in the shortest time possible. For discussions, grading is done after the replies are due. If I have a larger than normal grading load, I will notify you of any delays in grading.

                                <p><em>First</em>, if you need help, get help early and often - if you wait until it is a crisis, it will be too late.</p>
                                <p>Here are some resources to get help in this class:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Contact me through Canvas or email for help - please give sufficient detail, including which assignment you are asking about and your issue.</li>
                                    <li>Call, skype, or stop by during my office hours - hours and number stated above. I am available outside of the listed hours by arrangement as well, online or phone. Skype can be used if screenviews are needed.</li>
                                    <li>Bring up any issues in your weekly mentor session.
                                        <li><a href="http://libguides.olympic.edu/index">Haselwood Library</a> has <a id="" class="" title="" href="http://libguides.olympic.edu/c.php?g=232024&amp;p=1540493" target="">LibGuides</a>, an assortment of online CIS texts.</li>

                                    <p> By taking this class, you are stating that you will be making appropriate time in your schedule to ensure success and have access to the resources required for this class. Research can be very time-intensive, so budget accordingly. Expect to spend 12-15 hours outside of class per week for every class credit to ensure success. If you usually take more time on coursework, be sure to allocate additional time. Start your research early and be proactive. Make regular progress on the research itself.
                                        <ol start="1">
                                            <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Due dates:</span> Assignments are due on time / date as noted in the Canvas classroom. Online postings are due by 11:59:00 pm of the due date. You can post assignments any time during the current module. Please do not wait until the last minute to post. All assignments are due by 11:59:00 pm of the due date listed for a given item using the appropriate drop box. No assignment will be accepted for grading after the last scheduled day of classes. See the late policy for grading on late work.</li>
                                            <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Monitor Your Progress:</span> You can monitor your progress by going to the Grades area in the Canvas classroom. Contact your instructor right away if you notice any discrepancies between an expected assignment grade and what is reported in the gradebook.</li>
                                            <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Deliverables:</span> You must do your own work; consultation with others is fine, but the end-products must be your work; don't copy the work of others, or have others to do your work. You will be asked to evaluate your peers' work in the final module.</li>
                                            <li> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Attendance</span>: Regular progress is strongly recommended for success in this class. The modules build on each other; you will not be able to succeed in this class by cramming in each module in an hour a week or by researching and writing a paper in the final week. Check in with the Canvas shell on a regular basis each week, and participate in all lab meetings. Material will be provided in labs that is not available in Canvas, and vice-versa. You are responsible for accessing and using all required resources provided, and doing so will be important to your success in this course.</li>
                                            <li> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Submitting Work:</span> Journal entries must be blog posts; Google and Wordpress both offer free blogging services. Your blog must be public, so you can submit the Web URL of each blog post to Canvas for your journal entry and progress report assignments. You do not have to use your real name or an existing google account on your blog if you do not wish to.</p>
                                    <p>All work must be submitted on Canvas. Ensure that all assignments are attached/deposited properly. It is your responsibility to ensure that all student submissions are in their proper place by their deadlines. Open a new browser window to check your submission, and do it early enough that you can resubmit before the due date if needed.</p>
                                    <p>Submissions submitted on time will be graded within one week of their due date, unless we have heavier than normal professional obligations, in which case you will be notified of the delay. Your grade will be based on the content, quality, accuracy, and timeliness of your assignment. Additional rubric detail is available in the course shell.</p>

                                    <p><strong>Late Policy:</strong></p>
                                    <p>Lab discussions and activities must be participated in at the time they occur. If you cannot attend a lab, please contact us at least 24 hours prior to determine an appropriate alternative activity and completion time for it.</p>
                                    <p>Progress reports and mentor sessions need to be completed in the week they are scheduled, as timely interaction is required to ensure steady progress on your research. Rescheduling must be agreed upon with your assigned instructor no later than 24 hours prior to your regular meeting time.</p>
                                    <p>Other work will only be accepted up to one week late, up to the last regular class meeting of the quarter. There is a 10% penalty for late work, prior to grading. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Work over one week late will not be accepted for grading.</span> No late work is accepted for grading after the last regular class meeting for the quarter, even if it is less than one week away.</p>
                                    <p>Any exceptions to this late policy must be agreed upon no later than one day prior to the due date; exceptions will only be made with verifiable proof of your inability to do so (for example, an accident report or emergency hospital admission), no exceptions.</p>
                                    <p>Late submissions will be graded at the instructor's discretion as time permits.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li id="connectivity">
                                    <p><strong>Connectivity</strong>:</p>
                                    <p> Everyone experiences technical difficulties including the Canvas website, the K-20 network, your Internet service provider, or hardware issues. Have an alternate plan in the event of technical difficulties, and do not wait until the last minute to submit your work. Know where your local WiFi hotspots and computing resources are and be prepared to get to them to submit your work on time. There are labs on each Olympic College Campus. Please notify us immediately if the issue cannot be handled by your alternate plan (i.e., wide area power outages or Canvas outages).</li>

                                    <p><strong>Etiquette/Netiquette:</strong></p>
                                    <p> This is a college level class. It is expected that the instructor and the students will be tolerant of others' views, be respectful in dealing with others, and use standard professional English in their communications, both written and verbal. Swearing is not respectful. Remember that capitalization and exclamation points are considered yelling, and texting lingo is not professional. Any violations of this policy may result in lowering of an assignment grade or your overall course grade, reporting the violation to student services, or administrative withdrawal from the course. Ask first if you are not sure if your note is offensive, and respect the opinions of others. Refer to the applicable <a href="http://app.leg.wa.gov/wac/default.aspx?cite=132C-120">WAC</a> on student conduct. </p>
                                </li>
                                <li id="email"><strong>Email: </strong>Netiquette applies to email text as well. Please follow these guidelines:</li>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Send course email through Canvas, not to my OC email. You will get faster turn-around, as Canvas takes priority during the term.</li>
                                    <li>Use an appropriate Subject line, change it if you are starting a new topic in a reply. If you send multiple replies before I respond, note that I may not see the earlier replies due to the way Canvas presents messages.</li>
                                    <li>I will respond to all Canvas messages within one school day during the term; on weekends, holidays, and breaks I am generally not checking messages and may not respond until the next school/contract day. If I have not answered your message within this timeframe, please re-send it and let me know as it may not have been received.</li>
                                    <li>Never assume email is private; others may be able to read or access your email, or it may be forwarded.</li>
                                    <li>If you do send email about the course to our @olympic.edu addresses, we generally aim to respond within 2 school days to emails from olympic.edu addresses during the term; on evenings, weekends, holidays, and breaks we are generally not checking email.</li>
                                    <li>We cannot respond to student inquiries from non-olympic.edu email addresses. This is per OC policy. We can respond to all Canvas messages, and you can set Canvas up so it forwards messages to, and accepts replies from, your non-OC email.</li>

                                    <p><strong>Academic Honesty:</strong></p>
                                    <p>Plagiarism and cheating are serious offenses and may lead to a failing assignment grade; failure in the course; and/or expulsion from the College. For more information refer to the <a href="http://www.olympic.edu/current-students/policies-processes/student-conduct-code">Student Code of Conduct</a>. Academic dishonesty includes cheating, plagiarism, fabrication, and facilitating academic dishonesty. Facilitating academic dishonesty includes providing your own work to someone else for their solution; do not put others in this situation, they cannot provide you with solutions, only guidance. Fabrication includes making up sources that do not exist; you must be able to produce all of your sources if requested.</p>
                                    <p>You are encouraged to work with one another to understand and discuss general concepts and approaches, but your work must be your own, and your writing must be in your own words. Except for group work, the assignments are to be completed individually, and as such you are expected to work on your own. I reserve the right to refuse to accept any assignment if you cannot demonstrate the ability to perform similar work when asked, if you cannot explain your answer or the approach that you have used, or if you cannot produce a source when requested. You need to develop and internalize the work yourself.</p>
                                    <p>This is particularly important with research -- whenever you use material from a source, that source must be immediately, properly cited and then a full reference supplied at the end of your paper/presentation. Please note: cut and paste of another's words is plagiarism. Quoting in a limited amount with a citation noted on the quote is permissible. Your words must be your own. Images must be appropriately sourced and cited as well.</p>

                        <p>Any student who feels they may need an accommodation based on the impact of a disability should contact the Access Services office in <a href="http://apps.olympic.edu/CampusMap/?b=HSS" target="_blank">HSS 205</a>, by email at <a href="mailto:AccessServices@olympic.edu">AccessServices@olympic.edu</a> or by phone at (360) 475-7540. More information may be found on <a href="http://www.olympic.edu/AccessServices" target="_blank">the Access Services website</a>. Access Services must be contacted at least two weeks before the accomodation is needed.</p>
                        <p> Please contact me via Canvas or see me during office hours concerning your accommodation request(s) after you have submitted them to Access Services, so I can meet your needs in class. </p>
                        <p> Note that about 10% of all OC students have some type of disability, both observable (like the use of a cane) as well as invisible (like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posttraumatic_stress_disorder" target="_blank">PTSD</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asperger_syndrome" target="_blank">asperger syndrome</a>). Most disabilities at OC are invisible. As instructors, we cannot disclose a student's disability. The decision to share with others is a choice of the student. </p>

#### Non-discrimination

Olympic College seeks to maintain a learning and working environment that 
is safe, welcoming, and respectful of the dignity of all members of the 
campus community.  Accordingly, the College prohibits discrimination on the 
bases of race, color, religion, national origin, age, disability, sex, sexual 
orientation, gender identity, pregnancy, veteran status and all other protected 
classifications.  If you witness or encounter any such discrimination, including 
sexual harassment, sexual assault, or other sexual misconduct, you are encouraged 
to report it to the Title IX Officer, Cheryl Nu√±ez, Vice President for Equity and 
Inclusion at cnunez@olympic.edu/360-475-7125, 
who will assist you in connecting with all possible 
resources.  You may also report it online (and anonymously) at 
[Report It, OC!](https://publicdocs.maxient.com/incidentreport.php?OlympicCollege)
or seek confidential counseling from 
]Counseling Services](http://www.olympic.edu/current-students/advising/counseling-services)
at 360-475-7530 or at HSS 203.  See also

#### Accomodations

Any student who feels they may need an accommodation based on the impact of a
disability should contact the Access Services office in 
[HSS 205](http://apps.olympic.edu/CampusMap/?b=HSS), 
by email at [AccessServices@olympic.edu](mailto:AccessServices@olympic.edu) 
or by phone at (360) 475-7540. More information may be found on 
[the Access Services website](http://www.olympic.edu/AccessServices). 
Access Services must be contacted at least two weeks before the accomodation is needed.

Please contact me via Canvas or see me during office hours concerning your accommodation request(s)
after you have submitted them to Access Services,
so we can meet your needs in class.

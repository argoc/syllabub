<p>See the Canvas Course or your <a href="https://olympic.instructure.com/calendar" target="_new">Canvas Calendar</a> for the current schedule of assignments.</p>

Each module has an assessment, a discussion, and a lab; see the Canvas course shell for additional details. 

Each module has an assessment due the first week of the module. This 
assessment is based on the reading, so is due before the course 
presentations are complete. You will have a course session available to 
bring questions from the reading for clarification. These assessments 
are not timed, and are open book and internet. They must be completed in
 one sitting â€” once you start the quiz, you must complete it without 
exiting &amp; returning; Canvas provides this information to me in its 
log of student quiz activity. Quizes are individual, not group, work. 
There are no re-takes.
</p><p>Each modules provide you with the opportunity to discuss a 
relevant XML topic. You will make an original discussion post in your 
own words that addresses the module's discussion question in a 
substantive manner, and make two substantive responses that analyze your
 peers' posts and add to the conversation.
Discussion questions are relevant to the current module and the course 
as a whole. Discussion Rubrics are available in the Canvas shell.</p>
<p>Each module gives you hands-on practice with XML by completing a lab.
 In each lab,  you develop and test XML to gain hands-on experience 
integrating the module's material with your overall XML knowledge. You 
will submit a lab package including documentation with screen shots and 
the files you created or generated. Labs are individual, not group, 
work. All labs include a debrief section for your reflection and 
feedback on the lab activities. Lab rubrics are available in the Canvas 
shell.</p>

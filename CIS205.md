See the Canvas Course or your [Canvas Calendar](https://olympic.instructure.com/calendar) for the current schedule of assignments.

Each module has an assessment, a discussion, and a lab; see the Canvas course shell for additional details. 

Each module has an assessment due the first week of the module. This 
assessment is based on the reading, so is due before the course 
presentations are complete. You will have a course session available to 
bring questions from the reading for clarification. These assessments 
are not timed, and are open book and internet. They must be completed in
 one sitting â€” once you start the quiz, you must complete it without 
exiting &amp; returning; Canvas provides this information to me in its 
log of student quiz activity. Quizes are individual, not group, work. 
There are no re-takes.

<!--
Each modules provide you with the opportunity to discuss a 
relevant XML topic. You will make an original discussion post in your 
own words that addresses the module's discussion question in a 
substantive manner, and make two substantive responses that analyze your
 peers' posts and add to the conversation.
Discussion questions are relevant to the current module and the course 
as a whole. Discussion Rubrics are available in the Canvas shell.
-->

Each module gives you hands-on practice with XML by completing a lab.
 In each lab,  you develop and test XML to gain hands-on experience 
integrating the module's material with your overall XML knowledge. You 
will submit a lab package including documentation with screen shots and 
the files you created or generated. Labs are individual work, not group 
work. All labs include a debrief section for your reflection and 
feedback on the lab activities. Lab rubrics are available in the Canvas 
shell.

Instead of the usual discussion/response activity, we are going to build our own XML wiki
on [PBwiki.com](http://www.pbwiki.com/). This site allows for private wikis, so your work will remain
"in the classroom" and not be publicly viewable. Only your peers and I will have
access to your contributions. You will get an invitation from me to your
student email to join the class wiki.  You will have the choice of making smaller
contributions throughout the quarter (providing definitions, examples, or tips)
or one larger contribution on an XML technology. You can earn
"bonus points" with additional contributions and feedback on your peers' work.
More information about this activity is in the course shell.
You will be provided with a copy of the wiki at the end of the term to use as 
your own XML resource in the future.


#### <i class="fa fa-tachometer" id="grading"></i> Grading

There are 400 possible points in this class. A minimum of 252 points are required for a grade.
Without prior arrangement, I will record a grade of '0.0' if your points are below 252 points. 
If a student fails the course or is given a NC, WP or WF, the instructor must report a last attended date. 
This date can have implications for some sources of funding. 
In this course the date the student last submitted work accepted for grading will be used as the 
last attended date.

See chart below for details.

<table style="border-collapse: collapse;" border="1" cellpadding="5">
<tbody><tr><th>Letter</th><th>GPA</th><th>Points</th><th>Percent</th><th>Qualitative Definition</th></tr>
<tr><td>A</td><td>4.0</td><td>384</td><td>96%</td><td>Superior course outcomes mastery</td></tr>

</tbody></table>

Points on work submitted on-time are usually posted seven (7) days after the 
due date. <!-- For discussions, this is done after the replies are due. --> For wiki
contributions this is done at the end of each module.
If I have a larger than normal grading load, I will notify you of any 
delays in grading.
See [Policies](#policies) for information on submitting work, the late 
policy, academic honesty and more.

Monitor your course progress and see what you have submitted by clicking 
on "Grades" on the class navigation on the class website. 

#### <i class="fa fa-keyboard-o" id="expectations"></i> Technical Expectations

This course uses computers and the language of computers. You are expected to be 
comfortable using a computer, particularly the Windows operating system; a web 
browser; e-mail; and the Canvas Learning Management System. You will be expected 
to create text documents in text editors, check your work using editor plug-ins,
or cut-and-paste into web forms, create and edit Word documents, open files with web 
browsers, take and save screen shots, and create Zip files of your work. On Canvas
you are expected to be able to take quizzes, 
post to discussions, submit assignments, find course information, view recordings, and use the 
Canvas messaging system, calendar, and gradebook, and similar skills.

If you do not feel comfortable with these skills, consult with an OC advisor for appropriate courses to take first.

It is expected that you have regular access to a Windows PC with Firefox, Notepad++ and Microsoft Word 2007
or newer installed, or administrator privileges so that you can install them. 
If you do not, you can install portable versions of Firefox and Notepad++ on a flash drive, and you can
access Microsoft Word 2010 via <a href="http://workspace.olympic.edu/">workspace.olympic.edu</a>.

You will need to have regular Internet access for completing 
and submitting coursework.
**Please develop a plan "B" in case you have issues with your normal Internet 
access and related software that might affect your ability to participate in this class.
Computer or software issue will not change your due date**

Computer labs are available at all OC campuses. See [Computer Labs](http://www.olympic.edu/services/computer-labs) 
on the OC website for their locations and hours. All PC labs have Firefox and Microsoft Word on the machines.

<li id="help"><b>Ask for help</b>:  
  <p><em>First</em>, if you need help, get help early and often - if you wait it can become too
  late. The instructor and tutors are all available to help you.</p>

<p>If you need assistance or are having problems in this class, please 
visit me in person or online so we can discuss your options. 
I am available outside of office hours, by arrangement.
The best way to contact me electronically is to use 
your Canvas Inbox. Canvas' Inbox is where I expect to locate student 
questions. 
All other methods may take longer and will not keep a centralized 
location for our correspondence. I monitor Canvas throughout the 
week during the term, 9am-7pm, and less on evenings, weekends and holidays.
</p>
<p>If you contact me through Canvas for help - please give sufficient detail, for example,
by attaching the source code file in question to the
message and explaining what is happening.
The subject needs to identify the topic or lab it is for;
references to past labs will not get prioritized so be sure to use the correct subject line. 
Stacking multiple messages to us with the same subject line may cause earlier 
ones to be disregarded, as Canvas displays the most recent one first.
</p>
<p>You can expect a response from me to your Canvas Inbox message 
within one school day; do not expect a reply on weekends, breaks, or 
holidays. If you are asking for assistance with a lab, that response may be a
request to meet to discuss your work so far.</p>
<p>
If we need to use email, you must use your Olympic College email account. 
Email from non-olympic.edu addresses will be ignored per OC policies.
More information on OC email student accounts can be found at: 
<a href="http://www.olympic.edu/Students/StudentEmail" target="_new">http://www.olympic.edu/Students/StudentEmail</a>. 
Please ask for help in a CIS lab if you have not been able to access your OC email account.
</p>
<p>If for some reason you have to use email (Canvas is preferred), 
the subject line of your email must include the class, your name, 
and the topic, like so: <code>CIS 205 | Jane Jones | Lab 1 Notepad++ won't start</code>. 
Email messages with that subject line format will be responded to within 
one business day during the term. Other subject lines may not be noticed
until I am catching up on older emails.</p>
<p>For help with coursework, you may also attend or call in during the 
<a href="http://faculty.olympic.edu/agarripoli/programmingtutors.html" target="_new">CIS Programming Tutor Sessions</a>.
Please only contact the tutors during their open lab time. They are 
students too, and need time for their own studies when not tutoring.
For Fall 2016, programming tutoring is being held in TEC-212.</p>
<p>The role of the tutors is to assist the student during tutor sessions in general approaches to problem 
solving, internalizing core concepts, and understanding constructs of a particular 
language. Tutors may review homework only to determine which topics require 
additional attention or review by the student so that they can be successful. 
<strong>Tutors and other students are not allowed to directly provide 
any part of a solution to a home work assignment.</strong>
The work must be the student's own. Tutors are required to report 
students that request help outside of tutoring hours or that request help directly 
completing a home work exercise to the instructor for the course they are seeking help with.</p>
<p>If you need help outside of class material, there are a wide variety of resources available to you.
See <a href="http://www.olympic.edu/services" target="_new">Student Services</a> and also 
<a href="http://www.olympic.edu/current-students/advising/counseling-services" target="_new">Counseling Services</a>
for assistance.</p>
</li>

<li id="etiquette"><b>Etiquette/Netiquette</b>:  
This policy defines the behavior expected of all who participate in this class, 
on ground and on line. 
It is expected that instructors and students will be tolerant of othersâ€™ views, 
be respectful in 
dealing with others, show common courtesy, and use standard professional English 
in their communications, 
both written and verbal. Remember that capitalization and exclamation points 
are considered yelling, and 
texting lingo is not professional. Ask first if you are not sure if your note 
is offensive, and respect the opinions of others. 
You are expected to behave in a professional manner, and will be held to a
standard of professional etiquette.
<p>Violations of this policy may result in lowering of an assignment 
grade or your overall course grade, reporting the violation to student services, 
or administrative withdrawal from the class. 
Disruptive behavior will not be tolerated in the classroom or online; see 
<a href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/WAC/default.aspx?cite=132C-120-076" target="_new">WAC 132C-120-076</a>. 
</p><p>Be respectful of others' opinions. Disagreement is fine but do so in a 
straightforward and polite way. There is nothing to be gained from making rude, 
insulting or abusive remarks verbally or electronically.</p>
<p>For ground classes, refrain from the following during discussion: talking 
over other people, using the computer (except for note-taking on the discussion), 
cell phones/pagers, gadgets, guests, eating, sleeping, or other disturbances 
to the class unless an alternative class mode of conduct is in effect. </p>
</li>

<li id="honesty"><b>Academic honesty</b>:  
No academic dishonesty will be tolerated, see 
<a href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/WAC/default.aspx?cite=132C-120-065" target="_new">WAC 132C-120-065</a>. 
Academic dishonesty includes cheating, plagiarism, fabrication, and facilitating academic dishonesty.
Facilitating <strong>academic dishonesty includes providing your own work to someone else for their solution</strong>; 
do not put the tutors or your classmates in this situation, they cannot provide you with solutions or partial solutions, 
only guidance and explanations.<p></p>

<p>Evidence of academic dishonesty will result in a forfeiture of points
 for an assignment and will be reported to student services. 
Continued violations may result in failing or being administratively 
withdrawn from the course.</p>

<p>Unless otherwise noted your assignments are individual assignments and I expect that
your work will be your own. At any point during the term, you should be able to
explain or duplicate any of your solutions for your assignments. I
reserve the right to refuse to accept any assignment if you cannot demonstrate the
ability to perform similar work when asked, or if you cannot explain your answer or
approach that you have used. I encourage you to talk with one another to
internalize and discuss general concepts and approaches, but your work must be your
own. This includes work with the tutors -- you cannot ask them to provide you 
with correct syntax and exact solutions, they can only guide you. 
You need to develop and internalize the solution yourself.</p>
<p>Please note: cut and paste of another's words is plagiarism. 
Quoting in a limited amount with a citation noted on the quote is permissible. 
Your words must be your own.</p>
</li>
 
 <li id="identification"><b>Identification</b>: 
All assignments must have your student name, assignment name, course and 
date clearly labeled.  Be sure
to follow all requested information formats in labs and posts.
Please see the Web site for the name of the assignment. Failure to follow 
this policy may result in the deduction of points on the assignment. 
</li>

<li id="preparation"><b>Preparation</b>:
Students are expected to have the <a href="#TextRequired">Course Textbook</a> and 
satisfy the <a href="#expectations">Technical Expectations</a> 
on or before the start of class. 
Any requested reading or activity should be completed
before the first class day of the module, so that the student can better 
participate in discussions and use lab time effectively.
Not having a text and not being prepared will not be an acceptable excuse for 
not being able to participate in class or to turn in assignments on time 
unless there is a textbook acquisition issue with the OC bookstore
(<a href="http://ocbookstore.com/" target="_new">OC Bookstore Web site</a>).
If there are no books on the shelf, please consult a staff member. 
Do not assume the bookstore is out of textbooks.
<p></p></li>

<li id="assignments"><b>Assignments</b>:  
By taking this course, you are stating that you will be making appropriate time 
in your schedule to ensure success and have access to the resources required for 
this class. 
<strong>Expect to spend about 3 hours per week for each class credit to ensure success.</strong> 
This is a 2 credit class. 
2 credit class = 6 hours of class work per week.
If you review class recordings several times, expect to spend additional time.  
Being a full-time student is a full-time job, with 15 credits easily 40+ hours per week for class and study time. 
<p></p><p>I know things can get busy. Planning is key.
Remember: You are responsible for your learning. 
You need to invest regular, consistent time to succeed in this course.
</p><p>Learning takes doing, not just listening to lectures or reading the text. 
The Labs, <!-- Discussions,--> Wiki, and Exams are key experiences to ensure you have 
learned the material and internalized the course outcomes. 
</p><p>You may be administratively withdrawn from the course 
if you do not complete the syllabus quiz within the first week of the term.
</p><p>Time management is your friend or your foe! 
Remember, the due date is not the "do" date.
Waiting until the evening of the due date to ask a 
question of an assignment will not provide success in this course. 
You may not get a response before the due date. 
That is your responsibility, you alone are responsible for your late start.
Start assignments early and be proactive.
<strong>No assignment will be accepted for grading after the last lecture day of the term.</strong>
 </p></li>
 
 <li id="duedates"><b>Due dates</b>:  
Assignments are due on time, the date for each is given on the course 
Canvas site. 
Online postings are due by 11:59 p.m. of the due date or they will be 
late. 
You can post assignments prior to their due date; grading is done once 
the due date is past. 
Please do not wait until the last minute to post your work -- expect 
connectivity issues with Internet access and plan accordingly.
<strong>
All assignments must be posted by 11:59pm of the due date listed for a 
given item using the appropriate posting for a given assignment to be 
considered as on-time.
Any assignment not submitted by that time will be considered late.
</strong> 
<p>If you want to have ungraded late work reviewed, 
you will need to bring it to my office hours for an in-person or in-Skype review.
</p>
Do not wait until the last minute to complete your assignments; that 
will not be excused. 
Note: work submitted in email or the Canvas Inbox will not be accepted 
for grading unless specified as part of an assignment or previously 
approved.
 <p></p></li>
 
 <li id="confirm"><b>Submitting Work</b>:  
When assignments are posted at the Web site, using the form provided, 
Canvas will tell you if it succeeded or failed. I strongly recommend 
returning to the course page in another browser window to verify that the 
Discussion Post or File Submission was successfully completed, and put in the
correct course and assignment. Since little or no 
paper is used in the course, your only documentation that you posted an assignment 
is the successful completion of a submission on Canvas. Please save your files 
and make screenshots of the successful submission. Keep them safe in the event 
of a system failure and/or loss of postings at the course Web site. To date, loss 
of data is extremely rare but can happen since we are using the Internet for 
transmitting data and software to save it at the far end. It is strongly recommend 
that you print out all your form 
confirmations and place them into a confirmation notebook as your backup. 
If issues do arise, one of the first things I may ask to see is your submission 
confirmation. <strong>Without a submission confirmation for an assignment, in
the correct course assignment, you may receive 0 points for an assignment.</strong>
<p></p>
<p>All requirements must be met for your submission to be accepted for grading. Follow
the directions provided in the assignment box to ensure all naming conventions, files requested, 
information requested, and formats requested are provided. </p></li>

<li id="latework"><b>Late work</b>:  
For this course, you are given 2 "Late Tickets" for your use.
A late ticket lets you turn in a lab or complete a quiz up to 5 calendar
 days late with no penalty. 
You must notify the instructor by the due date of the assignment if you 
plan to use a late ticket for the assignment, using the Late Ticket drop
 box. 
 When you have used all of your late tickets, no more late work will be 
accepted. 
</p><p>Late tickets do not apply to the wiki; that work needs to be completed by the last
day of the quarter. Work completed in each module will be graded at that time.</p>
<!--
<strong>Late Tickets can not be used for Discussions since they are time sensitive. </strong>

<p>I recommend that you hold on to your Late Tickets as long as possible for real 
emergencies, as additional late tickets will not be provided.  
The last day to post late work is the last date of regular classes, June 13, 2016.
This class has 2 late tickets, use them wisely!    
</p>
<p>If a late assignment is accepted for grading, 
it will be at the discretion of the 
instructor as to when the assignment will be graded. 
</p>
<p>If you have a <strong>one time event</strong> that is a serious illness or accident, or active duty 
for you, your parent, your spouse, your child, or your legal ward, the late policy may be waived.
You must make your request through Canvas at least one full day before the assignment 
is due for a late policy waiver or have verifiable proof of your inability to make the request by that time. 
</p><p>
Vacations, colds, or other discretionary activities will not be accepted. 
On-going or pre-existing situations can not be used for reasons for late work as 
they were known constraints at the start of the course. 
</p><p>A late waiver is a one-time, one-assignment event, and any excused late work will not transfer to additional assignments.
You will need to catch up with the course schedule and continue on time.
If for some reason you cannot catch up, you can contact Registration &amp; Records 
to withdraw; it is not sufficient to tell me that you are withdrawing.
</p></li>

<li id="withdraw"><b>Withdrawing</b>: 
If you wish to withdraw from this course, please file
the appropriate paperwork with the Office of Registration and Records and then inform me of your decision.
If you are still in the gradebook at the end of the term,
your computed grade with 0's for unsubmitted work will be used unless you have been in
contact with me previously to make other arrangements. 
It is your responsibility to contact Registration and Records,
otherwise you remain enrolled in the course.
</li>

<li id="redo"><b>Redo work</b>:  
Occasionally I will request that an assignment be redone in whole or in part because it appears that 
the learning outcomes may not have been met regarding that assignment. 
If a redo is requested, a notice will posted in the Comments section of the 
assignment along with the current grade.
You need to resend the requested redo assignment within 3 days of the request,
or one week from the original due date, whichever is later. However, redo work 
will not be accepted after the last lecture day of the term. If not submitted in
a timely fashion, the redo will not be graded and the original grade in Canvas will stand. 
Please contact me via Canvas or during my office hours for instructions and support.
</li>

<li id="attendance"><b>Attendance</b>:
Attendance and success in this course have a strong correlation. Attendance means attending live or keeping up with the
course videos and readings; be prepared before coming to class or watching a recording,
and keep up with videos during their module. 
New concepts tend to build on previous concepts rather than stand on their own. 
If you have to miss class or delay viewing a video
I suggest you network with other students to gather notes as soon as possible (days, not weeks). 
Utilize office hours and the tutors to ask for assistance. I am happy to make appointments outside of my listed office hours.
